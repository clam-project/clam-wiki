We are currently generating Windows binaries crosscompiling from Linux.
In [[Devel/Windows MinGW cross compile]] we give a detailed procedure
that could give some clues if you want to natively compile in Windows
using MinGW.

'''Setup a MinGW/MSYS environment to build CLAM on Windows 2000/XP.'''

In order to compile CLAM framework on Windows, You will need [http://www.scons.org/ scons].
Scons is a python script that help developers to build their project. So You will need [http://www.python.org/ Python] too. Windows's Python implementation has a limitation on the length of the command line it can execute, so, in order to remove this limitation You will need also [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ pywin32].

Once that Python, pywin32 and scons are installed on Your system, You're ready to install [http://www.mingw.org/ MSYS] and [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW]. MSYS is a minimal Unix-like environment for Windows and can (not too much) easily be replaced by any other similar tool. MinGW is a gcc based compiler and a set of utilities able to build pure Windows binaries. MSYS/MinGW distribution is mainly packaged in tar.gz form. They have also some installers, but they are a bit outdated, so it is better to install .tar.gz packages by hand. All MSYS and MinGW files can be retrieved from [http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435 this page].

A good choice to extract packages is [http://www.7-zip.org 7-zip] a powerful opensource file archiver.

'''First we need to install the MSYS environment.''' Install first the ''MSYS Base System''. I prefer 1.0.11 version, since it has more updated tools. You will need almost all non source packages, so it's better to download them all. You need to extract first msysCORE and MSYS. These are needed to have a very minimal shell.
Once extracted, start msys.bat and continue to extract packages from this shell. This is a required since the only tool I've found that is able to extract correctly these packages is MSYS tar (With other tools You will have a lot of empty file). You may need to extract some packages with an external archiver, such as the one containing an updated tar or an updated bzip2: You're still using Windows, so You will not be able to replace a file/program in use.

To extract packages with tar, issue one of these command:
''tar jxvf foo.tar.bz2''
or
''tar zxvf foo.tar.gz''
You need the first to extract bzipped tar files, You need the other to extract gzipped tar files.


Be careful to extract the packages in a location that doesn't contain spaces (i.e.: '''NOT''' inside ''C:\Documents and Settings\User\MinGW\''.) or the msys.bat and a lot of other tools later, will not work. I Usually choose something like ''C:\Programs\GNU\msys\'' as installation base dierectory for MSYS/MinGW.

Once the ''MSYS Base System'' is installed You need to install the packages inside ''MSYS Supplementary Tools'' too. Once again You will need almost all non source packages, so it's better to download them all. Install them from the MSYS shell.
