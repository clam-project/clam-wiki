= CLAM Music Annotator ver 0.3.1 =

== Purpose ==

[[Image:Annotator-SplashScreen.png|thumb|Splash screen]]

The [http://clam.iua.upf.edu CLAM] Music Annotator is a GPL tool that can be used to visualize, check and
modify music information extracted from audio: low level features, note
segmentation, chords, structure... The tool is intended to be useful for
the music information retrieval research whenever you need to:

* Supervise and correct the results of automated audio feature extraction algorithms.
* Generate manually edited annotations of audio as training examples or ground truth for those algorithms.

== Features ==

[[Image:Annotator-Tonnetz-Keyspace.png|thumb|The keyspace and tonnetz views to visualize the automatic chord extraction]]

The CLAM Annotator is not tied to a fixed description scheme (the set of
attributes). You can define the working attribute set by providing an XML
description schema definition. Sample description schemes and an extraction
programs are provided with the Annotator but you could implement your own
one with different algorithms and attributes. Also tools are provided to
select and join attributes from the output of several description sources.

Other key features are:
* Attribute types:
** Free text
** Enumeration
** Bounded float
** Bounded integer
** Float array
** Frame Division (Equidistant division)
** Segmentations (Sizeless, Gapless, Overlapless or Free)
** ... more to come
* Several time segmentations and frame divisions can be defined at once (notes, structural parts, bars, beats, different frame sizes...).
* Each segmentation or frame division have its own set of attributes to attach to their childs.
* Auralization for the segmentations (click on the beggining)
* Auralization for the low-level descriptor (magnitude to freq)
* Instant views:
** [http://members2.boo.net/~knuth/ Tonnetz] for PCP like (tones correlation) display
** [http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/publicacions.php?did=337 Key Space] for major and minor chords correlation
** ... more to come

==First Steps with the Annotator==

* Install and run the CLAM Music Annotator.
* '''Use the ''What's this'' button [[image:AnnotatorIcon-WhatsThis.png]] or Shift-F1 to get additional help on any of the graphical elements.'''
* Open [[image:Annotator-IconOpenProject.png]] the '''Chords.pro''' project from the Music Annotator examples. If your are running on Windows, get one level up and open '''Samples''' dir. 
* Go to the '''Song descriptors''' tab and select a song. Debaser's Wooden House, for example.

* Go to the '''intra-song descriptors''' tab. Click the Play [[image:AnnotatorIcon-Play.png]] button and you should see the animated key-space and tonnetz views flashing.

* How to interpret those views
** The upper one displays some numbers extracted along the chords for each instant. Not that interesting if you are not developing an extractor.
** The second view is the one with the detected chord segments. You probably need to zoom in to be useful. When you click a segment it is highlighted and the attributes for the segment (chord root and chord mode) are shown on the right.
** The Tonnetz view is the one with the hexagons. Hexagons represent sounding pitches, they are arranged in such a way that  common chords modes draw identificable shapes, for example the pointing down triangle on the previous screenshot is the figure for a minor chord. Use the context help to see a list of common shapes.
** The KeySpace view is the one at the bottom. It displays the instant tonality which matches with major and minor chords. Chords sharing pitches are arranged closer so the stronger one can be identified better by contrast. Note that this view only displays major and minor chords.
* You can click follow-play button [[image:AnnotatorIcon-FollowPlay.png]] to see a more detailed detection of the chord on the segment properties pane, supporting other modes than major and minor.
* To analyze your own mp3 or wav files: Go to the '''song descriptors''' tab and do: '''Project, Add Song to Project''' [[image:AnnotatorIcon-AddSong.png]].  Select the new song, ignore the error message and click '''Song, Compute Descriptors''' [[image:AnnotatorIcon-ComputeDescription.png]]
* Wait until the execution ends and then click '''Song, Reload Descriptors'''  [[image:AnnotatorIcon-ReloadDescription.png]]
