= CLAM Music Annotator ver 0.3.1 =

== Purpose ==

[[Image:Annotator-SplashScreen.png|thumb|Splash screen]]

The [http://clam.iua.upf.edu CLAM] Music Annotator is a GPL tool that can be used to visualize, check and
modify music information extracted from audio: low level features, note
segmentation, chords, structure... The tool is intended to be useful for
the music information retrieval research whenever you need to:

* Supervise and correct the results of automated audio feature extraction algorithms.
* Generate manually edited annotations of audio as training examples or ground truth for those algorithms.

== Features ==

The CLAM Annotator is not tied to a fixed description scheme (the set of
attributes). You can define the working attribute set by providing an XML
description schema definition. Sample description schemes and an extraction
programs are provided with the Annotator but you could implement your own
one with different algorithms and attributes. Also tools are provided to
select and join attributes from the output of several description sources.

Other key features are:
* Attribute types:
** Free text
** Enumeration
** Bounded float
** Bounded integer
** Float array
** Frame Division (Equidistant division)
** Segmentations (Sizeless, Gapless, Overlapless or Free)
** ... more to come
* Several time segmentations and frame divisions can be defined at once (notes, structural parts, bars, beats, different frame sizes...).
* Each segmentation or frame division have its own set of attributes to attach to their childs.
* Auralization for the segmentations (click on the beggining)
* Auralization for the low-level descriptor (magnitude to freq)
* Instant views:
** [http://members2.boo.net/~knuth/ Tonnetz] for PCP like (tones correlation) display
** [http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/publicacions.php?did=337 Key Space] for major and minor chords correlation
** ... more to come

==First Steps with the Annotator==

* Execute Annotator (from Windows menu)
* Open '''Chords.pro''' project (if your are running on Windows, get one level up and open '''Samples''' dir)
* Go to the '''Song descriptors''' tab and select a song. Debasers Wooden Hose, for example.

* Go to the '''intra-song descriptors''' tab. Click the Play button and you should see the animated key-space and tonnetz views.
* You can click follow-play button to see a more detailed detection of the chord on the segment properties pane, supporting other modes than major and minor.
* To analyze your own mp3 or wav files: Go to the '''song descriptors''' tab and do: '''Project, Add Song to Project'''.  Select the new song, ignore the error message and click '''Song, Compute Descriptors'''
* Wait until the execution ends and then click '''Song, Reload Descriptors'''
* '''Use the ''What's this'' button or Shift-F1 to get additional help on any of the graphical elements.'''
