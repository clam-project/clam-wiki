== GSoC TODO's ==

Some short term goals for getting accustomed with the code:
* Make the parameters of TonalAnalysis configurable in NetworkEditor
* Make a precomputed SparseKernel for the default configuration
* Seperate the inner workings of TonalAnalysis into Processing Composites

== Detection algorithm enhancements ==

Several algorithm enhancements are to be considered:
* Preprocessing
** '''[done]''' Compute instant tunning by fasor addition on chroma peaks mapped to a semitone
** '''[done]''' Limit the time scope of the global tunning computation (done but improvements needed)
** Improve the limited scope tunning
* Processing
** Find faster and more precise algorithms than the current one	
*** Emilia's algorithm (peak detect before folding)
*** Wavelet based
*** Self-Correlation based
* Postprocessing
** '''[done]''' Consider the None chord (all pitches) so that we can detect non chord segments and use it as reference for pitchness.
** Symbolical analysis: Instead of correlation, analyze the pcp content using heuristic reasoning (Harte did plain filtering and some )
** Double scope for analysis: Too large windows difuminate transitions but small ones fail to detect arpeggios based chords. We could choose depending on the number of high pitches on the PCP.
** Onset alignment: Use realtime onset detection (aubio?) to 'quantize' the chord segments limits.

== Helper information ==

Enrich algorithm output so that the user may take profit of non-perfect algorithm or music that is not using recognized cords (fifths, rare chords...)
* Diffuse guessing: Minimize false positive impact to the user by computing a confidence value for each guess.
* Keeping several candidates so the user may view that he has more than one option.
* Rectified guess: Do a first realtime guess and correct it later if needed as the song goes on. 

== Visualization ==

In parallel to enhance the algorithm to realtime some views must be developed.
Some views ideas:
* '''[done]''' KeySpace (Emilia and Jordi's)
* Augmented KeySpace (not just major and minor)
* '''[done]''' Tonnetz (pcp)
* Add chord figures to Tonnetz
* Chord torus (map pcp into the tonal torus space)
* Vectors in chord torus (needed to disambiguate dim chords)
* '''[done]''' Chord ranking: all chords displayed as sorted probability bars
* Highlight or filter candidates on chord ranking
* Chord candidates: just the ones before the first strong decay
* Realtime segment construction:
** Instant chord segment: Display segment based on the best one on each instant.
** Delayed segment: don't display a segment until we have enough information on the future to make a post processing
** Guessed segments: Until sure, display the guess
* Instrument fingering (playback suggest

* Integrate a tunner
