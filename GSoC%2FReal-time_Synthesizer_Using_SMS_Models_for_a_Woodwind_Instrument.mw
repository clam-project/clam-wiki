(Just like many other things, I hope that I had this in the first day when I started to work on this project.)


This synthesizer for a woodwind is a further development
of Greg's continuousExcitationSynthesizer, a real-time synthesizer for an ebow-driven string instrument  in SoC 2007.


Here is the link:

Let's start from how it works.


Platform:
It is supposed to work either as a plugin in Network Editor or as a command line tool.


I/O:
It could take OSC or read the score files offline 
Rather than musical notation, the "score" file is actually a sequence of frequency-loudness duplets, 
which is all the expression that the instrument could have.
