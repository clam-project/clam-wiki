= Domain =

* We want to visualize data on the outports
* Each outport is binded to a single DSP datatype.
 The FFT outport data is an Spectrum
* Each DSP datatype may have different aspect suitable to be visualized.
 We could visualize the log or linear magnitude, the complex values, the phase...
* PortMonitor input port is also binded to a DSP datatype.
* A PortMonitor maps an aspect to a visualization datatype.
 
* Visualization datatype is abstracted as a datasource interface
* The widget reads a given datasource
* A widget could have several data sources

= Use cases =

== Prototyper Binding ==

The Prototyper has a widget related to a processing port.
It has to figure out which PortMonitor is needed to bind
the data source to the processing port type.

== PortMonitor instantiation on NetworkEditor ==
