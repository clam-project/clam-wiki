== Widget related tasks ==
(All being addressed as part of [http://iua-share.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/GSoC/Enhancing_Clam%27s_Widgets Bennett's GSoC work] unless otherwise noted)
* Add Properties to Attributes
** update ClamExtractorExample
** [[Image:done.png]] On BuildSchema, add a call to add 'Frame::SpectrumMagnitude', guess or invent the bin gap and offset.
** [[Image:done.png]] On MFCC2Pool get the write pool for such attribute and fill it.
** [[Image:done.png]] Regenerate the example pool data
** [[Image:done.png]]add properties to the FloatArray type on the schema
** [[Image:done.png]]use such properties to fill the FloatArrayDataSource interface
** [[Image:done.png]] PFADS::nBins() should be taken from the new attribute property NBins if available, if not, from the labels size as it is done now.
** [[Image:done.png]] PFADS::getLabel should return:
*** [[Image:done.png]] The binLabel if bin<_binLabel size.
*** [[Image:done.png]] A numeric representation if the needed attribute properties is available
*** [[Image:done.png]] Empty string or 'ERR' if not

*Update InstantViewPlugin
** For BarGraph filter FloatArrays without binLabels AND without NBins
** Adapt all the InstantViewPlugins to use the NBins when available.
** Run the Annotator, add a BarGraph for SpectrumMagnitude and send adevelopment screenshot to the wiki ;-)

* Add Scrolling Spectrogram view
**Add to Network Editor
**Port to Annotator

== Scheduled tasks ==

* When no pool can be loaded do something. What?
** Allow starting a pool from scratch
* When a song is deleted, go to no-song state: unselect songs and clear its descriptors
* Check schema loading when editing it on project properties
* Dump back the edited segmentation on the proper way depending on the kind of segmentation
* Initialize to the first segmentation after new schema
* Handle no segmentation after new schema
* Initialize to no song after project loading
* Allow not selecting any song.
* (?) Initialize to the first frame attribute after new schema
* (?) When no frame attributes, hide the frame level attribute pannel
* (?) When no segmentation, hide the segmentation pannel
* Bug: Source Aggregator should rename the child scopes accordingly
* Bug: Display message instead of crashing when incorrect segmentation points read
* Bug: Display message instead of crashing when an attribute is missing
* Bug: Ignore (not crashing) an unsupported attribute
* Option: Playhead always visible
* Feature: Key bindings for segment edition
* Feature: Current segment always visible
* The vertical rulers on the bpf editor are not displayed until a vertical resize
* Syncronize zooms and scrolling among plot widgets
* Support for <List> tag inside multiple item attributes (currently xoliver's annotations have to be checked to avoid the usage of this tag)

== Unscheduled tasks ==

* (Low priority) Strong dragging a bound (next and previous bounds are also moved)
** Reproduce the previous behaviour but the limitation on previous and end bound
** Dragging beyond next bounds move them
** Dragging beyond next bounds move them limit lenght
** Dragging beyond previous bounds move them
** Dragging beyond previous bounds move them limits to 0
* (low priority) Body dragging
* (low priority) Body strong dragging
* (low priority) Fix: ContinuousPolicy: When more than two onsets gets colapsed, you can't drag them. Solution: When picking when several onsets have the same value, the nearest one depends on the side you are clicking by index order.
* Make Pool XML related errors being exceptions instead failed assertions
* Change Onsets/Offsets into Beginnings Endings
* Handling of attributes pending of annotation (have no data)
* Error conditions on inserting and deleting on pools:
** Error inserting outside range
** Error inserting on non instanciated
** Error remove outside range
** Error remove on non instanciated
** Test XML still works fine
** Dealing with zero size scopes
* TDD Implementation of SizelessSegmentation
* TDD Implementation of OverlapingSegmentation
* Corrections on XML dumping
** '''[DONE]''' Simplify the RestrictedString XML
** '''[DONE]''' Rename RestrictedString to Enumerated
** Make the Enumerated be a CLAM Enum
** Bound Text elements to allow using them on multielement scopes, not just the song one.
* Updating changes on the annotation
** Dump old data on the pool when changing the annotation
** When segmentation moved change the underlying pool attribute
*** Option 1: Whenever it changes?
*** Option 2: On leave semgentation?
** What to do with half edited attributes
** Review that every edit marks the descriptors as changed.
* Error/Warning message on segmentation errors when loading it
* '''[Done]''' Not crashing so miserably when the click fails loading
* (high priority) Reliable application flow
** Viable project from scratch
*** 'New project' action choses a path for the project
*** '''[DONE]''' 'New project' action choses an schema
*** What to do when adding a file that has no pool?
** [david] Reliable project file content
** Make the file paths relative to the project dir location instead of the working dir
*** '''[DONE]''' Change the song files
*** '''[DONE]''' Change the schema files
*** '''[DONE]''' Fix: Not adding project path to absolute paths
*** Refactor the code to centralize path related operations
** Convert filenames to backslashes in windows. Needed??
** Consider independent pool and wave filenames.
* Documentation into the Schema Browser
** Adding an attribute on the description schema with the url or the xml
** Make this documentation available to the schema browser
* Heights
** Clarify some aspects:
*** How to choose the attribute that is height controlled
*** How to feed the attribute to the editor
*** Which pool update policy
*** Mapping units and limits
** Pick function (just in segmentation)
** Drag function (just in segmentation)
** Visual height hovering
*** Highlight
*** Tooltip 'Attribute: X units', pe. 'MaxFreq: 240Hz'
** Visual height dragging
*** Add state for dragging heights
*** Entering and exiting the state
*** Comunicate drags
** Cross updating table attributes and heights
* (low priority) Colors by value
** Clarify some aspects:
*** How to map attributes to colors?
*** Can the choosing method for height be used also for colors?
*** Should we force to be the same attribute for color and height?
*** Adding a thicker lower bar will illustrate better the color?


== Global Goals for Simac ==

* Numeric attributes does not get changed until you exit the cell
* Descriptor Table Plugin for Chords
* Frame view: Spectrum, Peaks
* Segment modes: Unsized, Continuous... (Cal decidir prioritaris)
* '''[Done]''' Segment display: Semitransparent box with opaque borders
* Mapping segment pool attributes to segment colors
* Mapping segment pool attributes to segment height
* Tooltip: Height handle, Time handles & Body
* Current Segment and keyboard segment navigation
* Changing enums attributes with keys maps
* Changing enums attributes with contextual menus
* Defining the (keyboard, mouse) user interaction as a whole to be coherent
