== Annotator extractor merger (Jun GSoC) ==

* Native windows compilation
** [[Image:done.png]] Compiling the libraries
** [[Image:done.png]] Compiling NetworkEditor
** [[Image:done.png]] Compiling Annotator/vmqt
** [[Image:done.png]] Compiling Annotator
** [[Image:done.png]] Compiling the plugins (not required)
** [[Image:done.png]] Compiling Voice2Midi (not required)
** Update the [[Devel/Windows_MinGW_build|native mingw compile wiki]]

* Training tasks:
** Take a look to the Pool related classes
** Build a simple extractor (c++)
*** [[Image:done.png]] Adapt the build system to compile the new binary 
*** Code a simple schema with a segmentation and no attribute
*** Create a pool according to the schema
*** Populate the pool with dummy data
*** Add to the TODO list the shortcommings found in the existing infrastructure during the session
*** Implement the command line options
*** Process the actual wave file
** Build a pool to lab converter (python)

=== Session plan ===

* Notice the duplication of schemas CLAM::DescriptionSchema and CLAM_Annotator::Schema
** Along the session we will identify which functions cover each one
** One long term TODO is to join them in a single one
* Dumping schema into the standard output:
** It requires <CLAM/XMLStorage.hxx>
** CLAM::XMLStorage::Dump(schema, "Schema", std::cout);
* Adding the segmentation attribute for the silences segmentation
** schema.AddSegmentation("Song","Silences",CLAM_Annotator::SegmentationPolicy::eDiscontinuous,"");
** Scope: 'Song', Name: 'Silences', Policy: discontinuous, ChildScope: none
** Notice again the duplication: ../CLAM/src/Data/Editable/Segmentation.hxx and it's subclasses.
** Run the program and notice how the XML for the schema has changed
* Add your own schema name
** schema.SetUri("descriptionScheme:www.iua.upf.edu:clam:JunJunSilenceDetector");
* Add documentation to the segmentation attribute
** Use schema.AttributeDocumentation(scope, attribute, doc)
* Create a CLAM description scheme and fill it
** CLAM::DescriptionScheme descriptionScheme;
** scheme.FillDescriptionScheme(descriptionScheme);
** Notice that this step is due to the scheme classes duplication
* Create a CLAM::DataPool with the description scheme
** Guess how
* Dump the pool
** What happens? file a bug ;-)

== Widget related tasks ==

* Make always visible playhead an option
* Option to display the playhead always on the center while playing (piano roll mode)

* Draggable handle for play position on the rulers
* Shared time ruler and time scrollbar for all views
* NetEditor scrolling segmentation view for Roman's chord extraction
* Spectrogram view on the Annotator
* Improve segmentEditor usability (better key bindings)
* complete the segmenteditor modes
** overlapping: not even implemented
** unsized: added but not really tested
** continuous/discontinuous: check adding at the end bug
* Adding attributes to the segments on the segment editor
** Labels
** Heights
** Colors
** Fill Patterns


* Investigate factoring plugins out of InstantViewPlugin.cxx or adding helper methods to reduce code repetition

== Scheduled tasks ==

* When no pool can be loaded do something. What?
** Allow starting a pool from scratch
* When a song is deleted, go to no-song state: unselect songs and clear its descriptors
* Check schema loading when editing it on project properties
* Dump back the edited segmentation on the proper way depending on the kind of segmentation
* Initialize to the first segmentation after new schema
* Handle no segmentation after new schema
* Initialize to no song after project loading
* Allow not selecting any song.
* (?) Initialize to the first frame attribute after new schema
* (?) When no frame attributes, hide the frame level attribute pannel
* (?) When no segmentation, hide the segmentation pannel
* Bug: Source Aggregator should rename the child scopes accordingly
* Bug: Display message instead of crashing when incorrect segmentation points read
* Bug: Display message instead of crashing when an attribute is missing
* Bug: Ignore (not crashing) an unsupported attribute
* Option: Playhead always visible
* Feature: Key bindings for segment edition
* Feature: Current segment always visible
* The vertical rulers on the bpf editor are not displayed until a vertical resize
* Syncronize zooms and scrolling among plot widgets
* Support for <List> tag inside multiple item attributes (currently xoliver's annotations have to be checked to avoid the usage of this tag)

== Unscheduled tasks ==

* (Low priority) Strong dragging a bound (next and previous bounds are also moved)
** Reproduce the previous behaviour but the limitation on previous and end bound
** Dragging beyond next bounds move them
** Dragging beyond next bounds move them limit lenght
** Dragging beyond previous bounds move them
** Dragging beyond previous bounds move them limits to 0
* (low priority) Body dragging
* (low priority) Body strong dragging
* (low priority) Fix: ContinuousPolicy: When more than two onsets gets colapsed, you can't drag them. Solution: When picking when several onsets have the same value, the nearest one depends on the side you are clicking by index order.
* Make Pool XML related errors being exceptions instead failed assertions
* Change Onsets/Offsets into Beginnings Endings
* Handling of attributes pending of annotation (have no data)
* Error conditions on inserting and deleting on pools:
** Error inserting outside range
** Error inserting on non instanciated
** Error remove outside range
** Error remove on non instanciated
** Test XML still works fine
** Dealing with zero size scopes
* TDD Implementation of SizelessSegmentation
* TDD Implementation of OverlapingSegmentation
* Corrections on XML dumping
** '''[DONE]''' Simplify the RestrictedString XML
** '''[DONE]''' Rename RestrictedString to Enumerated
** Make the Enumerated be a CLAM Enum
** Bound Text elements to allow using them on multielement scopes, not just the song one.
* Updating changes on the annotation
** Dump old data on the pool when changing the annotation
** When segmentation moved change the underlying pool attribute
*** Option 1: Whenever it changes?
*** Option 2: On leave semgentation?
** What to do with half edited attributes
** Review that every edit marks the descriptors as changed.
* Error/Warning message on segmentation errors when loading it
* '''[Done]''' Not crashing so miserably when the click fails loading
* (high priority) Reliable application flow
** Viable project from scratch
*** 'New project' action choses a path for the project
*** '''[DONE]''' 'New project' action choses an schema
*** What to do when adding a file that has no pool?
** [david] Reliable project file content
** Make the file paths relative to the project dir location instead of the working dir
*** '''[DONE]''' Change the song files
*** '''[DONE]''' Change the schema files
*** '''[DONE]''' Fix: Not adding project path to absolute paths
*** Refactor the code to centralize path related operations
** Convert filenames to backslashes in windows. Needed??
** Consider independent pool and wave filenames.
* Documentation into the Schema Browser
** Adding an attribute on the description schema with the url or the xml
** Make this documentation available to the schema browser
* Heights
** Clarify some aspects:
*** How to choose the attribute that is height controlled
*** How to feed the attribute to the editor
*** Which pool update policy
*** Mapping units and limits
** Pick function (just in segmentation)
** Drag function (just in segmentation)
** Visual height hovering
*** Highlight
*** Tooltip 'Attribute: X units', pe. 'MaxFreq: 240Hz'
** Visual height dragging
*** Add state for dragging heights
*** Entering and exiting the state
*** Comunicate drags
** Cross updating table attributes and heights
* (low priority) Colors by value
** Clarify some aspects:
*** How to map attributes to colors?
*** Can the choosing method for height be used also for colors?
*** Should we force to be the same attribute for color and height?
*** Adding a thicker lower bar will illustrate better the color?
