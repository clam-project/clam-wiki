**Title:** [Enhancing Clam’s Chord Detection for Real-time](http://code.google.com/soc/clam/appinfo.html?csaid=B829C32C3D9D7B13)

**Abstract:** I will improve chord extraction in CLAM (C++ Library for Audio and Music) for real-time usage. Before the start of the summer, as part of my studies, I will perform research on the current state of this specific area of audio digital signal processing. Then I will try to compare the most promising algorithms by implementing them in CLAM. I will also try to improve the visualization of the results. As a by-product of the research phase I would also like to explore the possibility of adding instrument recognition in the future.
