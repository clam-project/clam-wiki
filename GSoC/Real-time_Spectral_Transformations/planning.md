The way of work with my mentor will be based on some principles of [agile development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_methodology).

The project will be also based in a [ set of milestones](GSoC/Real-time_Spectral_Transformations#Milestones "wikilink") and every one or two weeks we can tweak the planning (as a consequence of the [agile development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_methodology) schema chosen)
