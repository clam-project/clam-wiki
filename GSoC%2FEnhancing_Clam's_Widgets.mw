==Milestones==
Weeks 1&2:
* Synchronize Annotator's KeySpace / Tonnetz / DataSource implementations with NetworkEditor's more up-to-date implementations
* Port BarGraph to Annotator InstantView

==Notes==

== Open Fronts on Widgets ==

Those are the open fronts on the widget arena -- dgarcia
* Conciliate and clean DataSource and KeySpace/Tonnetz views
* Migrate new InstantViews from NetEditor: BarGraph, Peak views, Polar peak views...
* Lower vmqt complexity
* Consider layers on the Instant Views
* Vector evolution view
* Tracks view
* Consider evolution views on the NetEditor
* Segment editor
** Assign Height/Color to segment data
** Implement pending segment editor modes
** Scrolling segment editor

==Ideas==
Add the following instant views to Annotator:

    * Peak
    * RMS
    * Spectrum
    * (still considering) perceived loudness i.e. Bark/Sone view 


Deliver the following usability enhancements to Annotator:

    * Add option to color-code segments based on segment value
          o something like MATLAB colormap ? 
    * Synchronize zooms and scrolling among plot widgets (Devel/Annotator TODO's)
    * Option to synchronize scrolling to playhead (Devel/Annotator TODO's)

==Mac-specific Caveats==
* extractors are bundled within Annotator.app, so for a project to see them the path the the extractors need to be passed to the app-- not just the extractor name.  i.e. /Applications/Annotator.app/Contents/MacOS/ChordExtractor instead of simply 'ChordExtractor'.  (using CLAM_Annotator-0.3.9~svn10111-powerpc.dmg, 15 May build)
* Annotator crashes when ClamExtractorExample is loaded (CLAM_Annotator-0.3.9~svn10111-powerpc.dmg, 15 May build)
