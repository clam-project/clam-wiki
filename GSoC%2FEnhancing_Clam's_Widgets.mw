'''Abstract:'''<br/>
Add the following instant views to Annotator:
*Peak
*RMS
*Spectrum
*''(still considering) perceived loudness i.e. Bark/Sone view''
<br/>
Deliver the following usability enhancements to Annotator:<br/>
*Add option to color-code segments based on segment value
**something like [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/colormap.html MATLAB colormap] ?
*Synchronize zooms and scrolling among plot widgets  ([http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Devel/Annotator_TODO%27s Devel/Annotator TODO's])
*Option to synchronize scrolling to playhead ([http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Devel/Annotator_TODO%27s Devel/Annotator TODO's])

==Milestones==
Weeks 1&2:
* Synchronize Annotator's KeySpace / Tonnetz / DataSource implementations with NetworkEditor's more up-to-date implementations
* Port BarGraph to Annotator InstantView

==Notes==
==Mac-specific Caveats==
* extractors are bundled within Annotator.app, so for a project to see them the path the the extractors need to be passed to the app-- not just the extractor name.  i.e. /Applications/Annotator.app/Contents/MacOS/ChordExtractor instead of simply 'ChordExtractor'.  (using CLAM_Annotator-0.3.9~svn10111-powerpc.dmg, 15 May build)
* Annotator crashes when ClamExtractorExample is loaded (CLAM_Annotator-0.3.9~svn10111-powerpc.dmg, 15 May build)
