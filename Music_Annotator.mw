= CLAM Music Annotator ver 0.3.1 =

[[Image:Annotator-SplashScreen.png|thumb|Splash screen]]


== Purpose ==

The CLAM Music Annotator is a GPL tool that can be used to visualize, check and
modify music information extracted from audio: low level features, note
segmentation, chords, structure... The tool is intended to be useful for
the music information retrieval research whenever you need to:

* Supervise and correct the results of automated audio feature extraction algorithms.
* Generate manually edited annotations of audio as training examples or ground truth for those algorithms.

== Features ==

[[Image:Annotator-Tonnetz-Keyspace.png|thumb|The keyspace and tonnetz views to visualize the automatic chord extraction]]

The CLAM Annotator is not tied to a fixed description scheme (the set of
attributes). You can define the working attribute set by providing an XML
description schema definition. Sample description schemes and an extraction
programs are provided with the Annotator but you could implement your own
one with different algorithms and attributes. Also tools are provided to
select and join attributes from the output of several description sources.

Other key features are:
* Attribute types:
** Free text
** Enumeration
** Bounded float
** Bounded integer
** Float array
** Frame Division (Equidistant division)
** Segmentations (Sizeless, Gapless, Overlapless or Free)
** ... more to come
* Several time segmentations and frame divisions can be defined at once (notes, structural parts, bars, beats, different frame sizes...).
* Each segmentation or frame division have its own set of attributes to attach to their childs.
* Auralization for the segmentations (click on the beggining)
* Auralization for the low-level descriptor (magnitude to freq)
* Instant views:
** [http://members2.boo.net/~knuth/ Tonnetz] for PCP like (tones correlation) display
** [http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/publicacions.php?did=337 Key Space] for mayor and minor chords correlation
** ... more to come

== Included Extractors ==

CLAM Music Annotator architecture is open to add extractors and data sources.
Just by providing an executable following the proper command line and output conventions.
Following command line and output conventions is not a major issue, 
we have successfully used python to wrap existing extractors that didn't conform.

CLAM Music Annotator comes with several extractors and data sources:

=== ClamExtractorExample ===

The ClamExtractorExample is a simple example of extractor using CLAM.
It generates three kind of descriptors:

* Low level spectral descriptors using CLAM
* ID3 descriptors
* Random segments (yes, they are random, just to test the Music Annotator)
* Random high level descriptors (yes, those are also random)

=== ChordExtractor ===

The chord extractor extracts segments labeled with chords.
It uses [http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=13128 Christopher Harte algorithm] with some minor variations.
It has been developed as a collaboration between the [http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk Queen Mary University of London] and the [http://www.iua.upf.edu Universitat Pompeu Fabra].

== Collective Annotation, the BOCA client ==

[[Image:Annotator-BocaPendingAnnotations.png|thumb|Checking pending annotations on the BOCA website]]

[http://simacservices.iua.upf.edu/boca BOCA, the Barebone Of Collective Annotations] 
is a web application that centralizes collective annotation campaigns.
Hand annotation is a hard task for researchers, but, sharing annotations
means, as for software, that you'll get more than you are giving.

BocaClient is a program that takes the task files BOCA generates and builds a Music Annotator
project by doing queries to the Simac Web Services.
After saving the project, the BocaClient uploads the changes back.

== Helper scripts ==

The source code tarball also includes some python scripts to perform usefull tasks as:

* Converting wavesurver lab files to and from Annotator's descriptors pools
* Merging pools and schemas from several sources
* Filtering attributes from pools and scopes
* Mapping attributes and attribute scope names
