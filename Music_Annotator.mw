= CLAM Music Annotator ver 3.1 =

== Purpose ==

The CLAM Annotator is a tool that can be used to visualize, check and
modify music information extracted from audio: low level features, note
segmentation, chords, structure... The tool is intended to be useful for
the music information retrieval research whenever you need to:

* Supervise and correct the results of automated audio feature extraction algorithms.
* Generate manually edited annotations of audio as training examples or ground truth for those algorithms.

== Features ==

The CLAM Annotator is not tied to a fixed description scheme (the set of
attributes). You can define the working attribute set by providing an XML
description schema definition. A sample description scheme and an extractor
program are provided with the Annotator but you could implement your own
one with different algorithms and attributes. Also tools are provided to
select and join attributes from the output of several description sources.

Other key features are:
* Attribute types:
** Free text
** Enumeration
** Bounded float
** Bounded integer
** Frame Division (Equidistant division)
** Segmentations (Sizeless, Gapless, Overlapless or Free)
** ... more to come
* Several time segmentations can be defined at once
* Each segment can have its own attributes
* Auralization for the segmentations (click on the beggining)
* Auralization for the low-level descriptor (magnitude to freq)

== Included Extractors ==

=== ClamExtractorExample ===

The ClamExtractorExample is a dummy example of extractor.
It generates three kind of descriptors:

* Low level spectral descriptors using CLAM
* ID3 descriptors
* Random segments (yes, they are random, just to test the Music Annotator)

=== ChordExtractor ===

The chord extractor extracts segments labeled with chords.
It uses Christopher Harte (Queen Mary University of London) algorithm
with some minor variations.

== BOCA Client ==

BOCA is the Barebone Of Collective Annotations. 
It's a web application that centralizes collective annotation campaigns.
Hand annotation is a hard task for researchers, but, by sharing them,
as for software, you'll get more than you give.

BocaClient takes the task files BOCA generates and builds a Music Annotator
project by doing queries to the Simac Web Services.
After saving the project, the BocaClient uploads the changes back.
