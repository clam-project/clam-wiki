This page gives advice on how to approach to CLAM.

== Installing and building ==

Binary packages are available for major platforms, so check out the [http://clam-project.org/download.html download page] before spending your time compiling from the source code.

When building from source code, look first of all the [http://iua-share.upf.edu/svn/clam/trunk/CLAM/INSTALL INSTALL] files distributed with the source code. CLAM applications also have an INSTALL file themselves.

Some platform specific issues are documented by the user community on the [[Main Page|wiki]] (Installation notes on the main page).

== Using the applications ==

Major application distributed with CLAM have a tutorial. Also on the [[Main Page|wiki main page]]. Usually a Help menu option of the application leads you to the application manual page on the wiki.

== Getting insight on CLAM concepts ==

A very recommendable step is reading the [[Network Editor tutorial]]. It explains the Network Editor application itself but also gives insight on
* Main CLAM inner concepts such as Processing, Port, Control, Configuration... 
* The processing objects which are available (SMS, Spectral, TonalAnalysis...)
* The visual prototyping work flow (how to visually develop applications)

== Coding with CLAM ==

Then, you might want to create CLAM applications which can not be just prototyped, or to define brand new processings. The [[Main Page#Documentation|wiki home page]] contains short howto's targeting concrete and progressive goals.

Further information may be get from the [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/doc/CLAM-doxygen/ doxygen documentation]
