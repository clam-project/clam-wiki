== On my Gentoo Desktop ==
Since I have both qt3 and qt4, I think there might be some conflicts.  The command that I just used is ` scons  prefix=/usr/local clam_prefix=/usr/local qt_plugins_install_path=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.3/plugins/designer/` after changing the $QTDIR variable to /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.3 . 

For the scons install phase, I have troubles b/c I think that the root user doesn't have the same environment (though the CLAM directory works fine).  Digging around, I find that since I manually installed QT4 (Gentoo didn't like haveing multiple versions), I need to put the QT4 programs on the PATH.  Here are the following lines from my .bash_profile from the abe user.

PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.3/bin:$PATH
export PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.3/lib:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

anyways, that didn't solve my problem, but actually it doesn't matter b/c I always just call the NetworkEditor from the directory where it is.... I will post back more when I get around to digging deeper.

More later, but I usually don't have problems with it...
