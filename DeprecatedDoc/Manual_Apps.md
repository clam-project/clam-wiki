The best way to approach the CLAM framework is by using some of its sample applications. Actually, some of those applications are much more than that...

We recommend you start by looking at the [Network Editor](Manual_NetworkEditor "wikilink"). This is actually a visual builder for CLAM and it will give you a nice (and visual) introduction to the CLAM metamodel.

Then depending on your DSP interests you might want to look at the [SMSTools](Manual_SMSTools "wikilink"), a tool for offline spectral analysis, transformation and resynthesis; or the [Annotator](Music_Annotator "wikilink"), an application for manual and semi-automatic labeling and descriptor extraction.

Have fun!
