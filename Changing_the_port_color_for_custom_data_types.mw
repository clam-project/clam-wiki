== Which token types does CLAM allow ==

Virtually any type of token can be communicated through processing ports,
provided that they are copyable and default constructable and they behave in a sane way.

Every port is bound to a given token type and 
can be connected just to complementary ports of the same token type.

== Registering a color for a token type ==

Since version 1.2, CLAM also provides a way to color the ports on the NetworkEditor depending on the type.
Registering token type color is not necessary to use such a token type on CLAM neither on the NetworkEditor.
If you don't, you'll just get the default color for ports.
But if you want, you can specify such color by defining the 
following object on any cxx file linked with CLAM libs, a plugins or any application:

 #include <CLAM/ProcessingDataPlugin.hxx>
 static CLAM::ProcessingDataPlugin::Registrator<MyDataType> registrator("fucsia");

Being fucsia the color to use for the ports that communicate MyDataType.

The color is any string representing a color specified on the [http://www.december.com/html/spec/colorsvg.html svg color names] or colors in the form "#RGB", "#RRGGBB", "#RRRGGGBBB".

 static CLAM::ProcessingDataPlugin::Registrator<MyDataType> registrator("#FF0000"); // Pure red
