CLAM allows any type to be used as processing type through processing ports
provided that is copyable and default constructable.

'''The documentation bellow refers to experimental features that can change before the release'''

CLAM also provides a way to color the ports on the NetworkEditor depending on the type.
You can get the default color but if you want to use an specific color for your own data type,
you should define the following object on any cxx file linked with CLAM libs, a plugins or any application:

 #include <CLAM/ProcessingDataPlugin.hxx>
 static CLAM::ProcessingDataPlugin::Registrator<MyDataType> registrator("fucsia");

Being fucsia the color to use for the ports that communicate MyDataType.

Registering the color is not necessary to use such a type on CLAM neither on the NetworkEditor.
