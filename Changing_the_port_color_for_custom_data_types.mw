== Which token types does CLAM allow ==

CLAM allows any type of token to be used through processing ports
provided that is copyable and default constructable.

== Registering a color for a token type ==

'''The documentation bellow refers to experimental features still in the svn that may change before the release'''

CLAM also provides a way to color the ports on the NetworkEditor depending on the type.
Registering token type color is not necessary to use such a token type on CLAM neither on the NetworkEditor.
If you don't, you'll just get the default color for ports.
But if you want, you can specify such color by defining the 
following object on any cxx file linked with CLAM libs, a plugins or any application:

 #include <CLAM/ProcessingDataPlugin.hxx>
 static CLAM::ProcessingDataPlugin::Registrator<MyDataType> registrator("fucsia");

Being fucsia the color to use for the ports that communicate MyDataType.

The color is any string representing a color specified on the [http://www.december.com/html/spec/colorsvg.html svg color names] or colors in the form "#RGB", "#RRGGBB", "#RRRGGGBBB".
