= spectral transformations =

* (high) harmonizer: Turn realtime/fix and port to NE 
* (high) morph: Turn realtime and port to NE
* (high) time-stretch: Turn realtime and port to NE 
* (high) pitch-discretization: Turn realtime and port to NE
* Fix gender change: already rt. Improve residual
* make a harmonizer prototype with sliders to control each voice pitch gain
* make a prototype to control harmonizer voices by midi
* odd-even-harmonic-ration: check
* sine-filter: check
* spectral-shape-shift: check

= audio to midi =

* realtime voice2midi
* make a network with rt audio to midi-output




* piano-roll widget for networkeditor/prototyper
