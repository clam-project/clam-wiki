= Unsorted tasks =

Not all the following tasks are meant to be part of the GSoC project.

== spectral transformations ==
* [[Image:done.png]] tweak some processings, bounds setting, adding defaults, etc.
* [[Image:done.png]] (high) harmonizer: port it to realtime and NE
* [[Image:done.png]] harmonizer algorithm improvement (detunning and delay added)
* [[Image:done.png]] (high) morph: port it to realtime and NE
* [[Image:done.png]] (high) pitch-discretization: port it realtime and NE
* [[Image:done.png]] make a harmonizer prototype with sliders to control each voice pitch gain
* [[Image:done.png]] time-stretch algorithm port basis
* [[Image:done.png]] new hoarseness network

* (high) time-stretch: finish the rt port and have it working in NE 
* Fix gender change: already rt. Improve residual
* make a network (and a prototype) to control harmonizer voices by midi (needs lv2 host implementation)
* fix SMS pitch-shift artifacts (bug)
* improve morph algorithm
* check if any mAmount dependency remains

== audio to midi ==

* [[Image:done.png]] fundamental to MIDI at NE and Audio2MIDI test network
* realtime voice2midi (needs lv2 host implementation) 
* make a network with rt audio to midi-output (needs lv2 host implementation)
* piano-roll widget for networkeditor/prototyper (needs lv2 host implementation)
