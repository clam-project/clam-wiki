= Unsorted tasks =

Not all the following tasks are meant to be part of the GSoC project.

== spectral transformations ==
* (high) harmonizer: port it to realtime and NE 
* (high) morph: port it to realtime and NE
* (high) time-stretch: port it realtime and NE 
* (high) pitch-discretization: port it realtime and NE 
* Fix gender change: already rt. Improve residual
* make a harmonizer prototype with sliders to control each voice pitch gain
* make a prototype to control harmonizer voices by midi
* odd-even-harmonic-ration: check
* sine-filter: check
* spectral-shape-shift: check

== audio to midi ==

* realtime voice2midi
* make a network with rt audio to midi-output
* piano-roll widget for networkeditor/prototyper

= milestones =

# pitch-discretization working in NE and prototyped example
# ''other transformations?''
# audio2midi in NE (using smsanalysis ''fundamental'' output)
# piano-roll (instant) view in NE and Prototyper/Designer
# harmonizer working in NE and prototyped example
# prototyped example of harmonized voices control.led by midi
# complex transformations: time-stretch and morph
