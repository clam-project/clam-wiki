= Unsorted tasks =

Not all the following tasks are meant to be part of the GSoC project.

== spectral transformations ==
* [[Image:done.png]] (high) harmonizer: port it to realtime and NE
* [[Image:done.png]] tweak more harmonizer algorithm (detunning and delay added)
* [[Image:done.png]] (high) morph: port it to realtime and NE
* [[Image:done.png]] (high) pitch-discretization: port it realtime and NE
* [[Image:done.png]] make a harmonizer prototype with sliders to control each voice pitch gain

* (high) time-stretch: port it realtime and NE 
* Fix gender change: already rt. Improve residual
* make a network (and a prototype) to control harmonizer voices by midi (needs lv2 host implementation)
* fix pitch-shifting artifacts (bug)
* improve morph algorithm

== audio to midi ==

* realtime voice2midi (needs lv2 host implementation) 
* make a network with rt audio to midi-output (needs lv2 host implementation)
* piano-roll widget for networkeditor/prototyper (needs lv2 host implementation)

= milestones =

# [[Image:done.png]] pitch-discretization working in NE and prototyped example
# [[Image:done.png]] Tweak some processings, bounds setting, adding defaults, etc
# audio2midi in NE (using smsanalysis ''fundamental'' output) (needs lv2 host implementation)
# piano-roll (instant) view in NE and Prototyper/Designer (needs lv2 host implementation)
# [[Image:done.png]] harmonizer working in NE and prototyped example 
# prototyped example of harmonized voices control.led by midi (needs lv2 host implementation)
# complex transformations: time-stretch and morph
