[Virtual Studio Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) (VST) is a plugin system introduced by [Steinberg](http://steinberg.net) which is mainly used in Windows and Mac.

You can embed a CLAM network, like the ones edited with the [Network Editor](Network Editor tutorial "wikilink"), and create a VST plugin for Windows.

No documentation on this issue is available but this [example](http://clam-project.org/clam/trunk/CLAM/examples/PluginExamples/VstPluginExample/).

VST GUI
-------

There is no working VST GUI support in CLAM but the former example contains the grassroots of an implementation for Qt based guis for VST, so future development lines will focus on getting Prototyper interfaces working as VST GUI plugins. Do you want to help us getting it working? Ask the development list.
