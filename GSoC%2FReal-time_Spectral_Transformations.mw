'''Abstract:''' Revamp all CLAM SMS transformations. Turn real-time all those still aren’t and have them working on Network Editor. For example: Harmonizer, Morph and Time Stretch. Make nice prototypes for use them with Prototyper and have special focus on some. Also make real-time Voice2Midi and all those widgets which can be needed.
