== TODO ==
* (med) more verbose keys for LadspaFactory. at least including "ladspa"
* (med) load plugins from LADSPA_PATH plus standard paths
* (low) add Ladspa tree and order it by cat
** (low) check for # of plugins to make a branch in the tree
* (med) check for non-valid directory
* (med) extract implementation in file LadspaFactory.cxx
* (med) '''new''' make LadspaFactory.hxx non-coupled with ladspa headers. so uses of LFactory don't need #ifdef USE_LADSPA. use Pimpl C++ idiom in LFactory.
* (HIGH) update LadspaFactoryTest with "real" classes
* (med) fix non-string bug in LFactory map
* (med) don't use a Config in LWrapper. Use NullConfig instead.
* strings /usr/lib/libasound.so | grep ladspa_descriptor ask lads
* change NetworkEditor processing loading logic:รง
** 1. put all info about processings in the factory
** 2. build QTree from factory data.
** 3. query list of processings of a given category to the factory.
* Factory:
** refactoring: clam creators being objects not functions
** unify clam and ladspa factory
** add new columns to the associative data-structure: category, description.


=== high level TODOs to discuss ===

* default values to controls
* save controls state with network
* automatic in-control sliders in networkeditor

* look out OM for Plugin and PluginLibrary
* check for empty LADSPA_PATH
* wrapper a plugin

* created LadspaPluginsExplorer (structure to hold Ladspa information)
* pass LadspaFactoryTest
* created LadspaFactory
