== Introduction ==

'''Python''' is a popular language. Flexible, expressive and fast for development. But by its nature it is not appropiate for doing real-time processing. Eventhough, you can use real-time ready modules in fast and real-time safe C++ and combine them using Python expressiveness.


'''ipyclam''' is a python module that wraps CLAM by providing the interface to do the same actions you could do with the NetworkEditor by connecting several CLAM modules playing them and like you would do with the Prototyper, connect them to a PyQt/PySide interface. Thus it enpowers the kind of prototypes you could build with such tools.
