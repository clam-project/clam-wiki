= What is able to do? =

Currently, CLAM is able to decode the following audio file formats:

    * Ogg/Vorbis
    * Mpeg Audio Layer I, II, III
    * Microsoft's WAVE/RIFF
    * SGI/Apple's AIFF
    * Sun's AU, SND
    * Paris Audio File (PAF)
    * Creative's VOC
    * and several more

obviously we haven't implemented ourselves the routines for achieving this from scratch. We use several free libraries like:

    * libsndfile ( http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile ) an excellent library by Erik de Castro.
    * Ogg/Vorbis SDK by http://www.xiph.org
    * Underbit's libmad http://www.underbit.com/products/mad

With exception of Mpeg Audio, due to IP fuss around Fraunh√∂fer, all decodable file formats can be encoded with the help of CLAM.

Besides being able to read and write audio data, there is also the possibility of extracting meta-data embedded in Vorbis or Mpeg bitstreams. In the case of Mpeg bitstreams, this implies to deal with ID3, the format for tagging Mpeg audio streams. We handle ID3 through id3lib http://id3lib.sourceforge.net

= Usage examples =
