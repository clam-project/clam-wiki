Unlike ports, controls are not bound to the execution of the Do method.
Controls are sent and received inmediately.
When a processing Do gets executed it just gets the last received value.

You can define and initialize InControls and OutControls in a similar way you did with In/OutPorts but they are not templated (to the date) since they are always CLAM::TControlData which renders to float or double depending on your compilation flags.

 	...
 	CLAM::InPort<MyInputDataType> mIn;
 	CLAM::OutPort<MyOutputDataType> mOut;
 	CLAM::InControl mInControl;         // <- New
 	CLAM::OutControl mOutControl;       // <- New
 	...

And at the initialization of the class:

 	MyProcessing(const Config & config=Config()) 
 		: mIn("My Input", this)
 		, mOut("My Output", this) 
 		, mInControl("In Control", this)   // <- New
 		, mOutControl("Ot Control", this)  // <- New
 	{
 	....

TODO: Correct place to set default input values: constructor, ConcreteConfigure or ConcreteStart?

Within the Do method, whenever we want to read a input value just do:

 	....
 	CLAM::TControlData controlValue = mInControl.GetLastValue();
 	....

And to send a value through a output control:

 	....
 	mOutControl.SendControl(3.1416);
 	....
