* Configurators for processing in plugins
* Solving parameter propagation problem
* [[image:done.png]] Complex->AudioBuffer IFFT
* [[image:done.png]] AudioBuffer->AudioStream OverlapAndAdd (named AudioBuffer2Stream)
* AudioBuffer2Stream: Provide its own configuration, now taking AudioWindowingConfig
* AudioBuffer2Stream: solve the gain problem
* Why window size is windowSize+1?
* Assert accepting strings (or formatting)
* [[image:done.png]] Profile new spectrum processings
** [[image:done.png]] Why the mixer is taking all the time!?? -> accessing sample by sample to GetData(sample)
** Forbid the port.GetData(sample) interface
** [[image:done.png]] Prepoint to buffers.
** [[image:done.png]] Optimize Sources and Sinks by no accessing the dynamictype accessor on the inner loop

== Audio File IO ==

* Add Encoding and Endianess fields to writer's configs
* Add TextDescriptors to writer's configs
* Abstract accessors to reader's Header (or to its fields) and to TextDescriptors and remove AudioFile accessor
* Simplify AudioFile hierarchy 
* Simplify writer and reader Processings inner code
* Do sample rate conversion
