This page gives advice on how to approach to CLAM.

Installing and building
-----------------------

Binary packages are available for major platforms, so check out the [download page](http://clam-project.org/download.html) before spending your time compiling from the source code.

When building from source code, look first of all the [INSTALL](http://clam-project.org/clam/trunk/CLAM/INSTALL) files distributed with the source code. CLAM applications also have an INSTALL file themselves.

Some platform specific issues are documented by the user community on the [Documentation](Main Page#Documentation) section (See Installation notes).

Using the applications
----------------------

Major application distributed with CLAM have a tutorial. Also on the [wiki main page](Main Page). Usually a Help menu option of the application leads you to the application manual page on the wiki.

Getting insight on CLAM concepts
--------------------------------

A very recommendable step is reading the [Network Editor tutorial](Network Editor tutorial). It explains the Network Editor application itself but also gives insight on

-   Main CLAM inner concepts such as Processing, Port, Control, Configuration...
-   The processing objects which are available (SMS, Spectral, TonalAnalysis...)
-   The visual prototyping work flow (how to visually develop applications)

Coding with CLAM
----------------

Then, you might want to create CLAM applications which can not be just prototyped, or to define brand new processings. The [wiki home page](Main Page#Documentation) contains short howto's targeting concrete and progressive goals.

Further information may be get from the [doxygen documentation](http://clam.iua.upf.edu/doc/CLAM-doxygen/)
