== Network editor port to Qt4 ==

We are working hard on having a first Qt4 port of the Network Editor.
We are considering the following roadmap:
* Having the GUI working with a simulated network '''[done]'''
* Integrating the interface with a real network
* Integrating Port Monitors and Controllers
* Make the Prototyper work with Qt4

Here you have some preview screenshots:
