== Network editor port to Qt4 ==

We are working hard on having a first '''Qt4''' port of the Network Editor doing some extra effort on '''usability'''.
Take a look at the [http://iua-share.upf.es/wikis/clam_draft/Network_Editor_Qt4_Port|Port progress page]. 
Here you have some preview screenshots for stage 1 (interface) and and stage 2 (real network inside):
