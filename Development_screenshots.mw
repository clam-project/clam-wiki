== Desktop integration ==

Image:Konqueror-networkicons.png|KDE integration using legacy mime system. KDE is not freedesktop compliant yet. so .

== Back to Mac ==

Today we have again almost all the applications compiling on MacOSX. 
Including the new NetworkEditor 0.4 and the tonal analysis processing.
Some work is still needed as you can see on the following screenshots.
Still nothing done to have binary packages working again, but at least it compiles.

<gallery>
Image:NetEditQt4-MacOSX-tonal.png|The first time NetworkEditor 0.4 have shown up its face in MacOSX!.

Image:Annotator-MacOSX-firsttry.png|The first compilation of Annotator with Qt4.2 in MacOSX It has some layout problems.
Image:Prototyper-MacOSX.png|Prototyper in MacOSX, doesn't show plugins. Still some work to do to have working qt plugins.
Image:Prototyper-PluginsWorking-MacOSX.png|And now with the work done!
Image:SMSTools-macosx.png|SMSTools showing sinusoidal tracks and spectrum in the Mac OSX platform.

== Network editor port to Qt4 ==

We are working hard on having a first '''Qt4''' port of the Network Editor doing some extra effort on '''usability'''.
Take a look at the [http://iua-share.upf.es/wikis/clam_draft/Network_Editor_Qt4_Port|Port progress page]. 
Here you have some preview screenshots for stage 1 (interface), stage 2 (real network inside) and stage 3 (data visualization and GUI prototyping):
