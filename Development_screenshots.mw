== Network editor port to Qt4 ==

We are working hard on having a first Qt4 port of the Network Editor.
We are considering the following roadmap
* Having the gui working without a real network '''[Done]'''
* Integrating it with a real network
* Integrating Port Monitors and Controllers (the hard part)
* Make the Prototyper work for Qt4 (maybe the hardest part)
