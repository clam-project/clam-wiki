== The fast dirty way ==

If you just want to build the packages for your own distribution state,
and you don't care about build dependencies and having an up-to-date system.
Do the following:

* If fedora is not your native platform chroot to the fedora partition.
 export FEDORA_ROOT=/media/sda5
 sudo mount /dev $FEDORA_ROOT/dev --bind
 sudo mount /home $FEDORA_ROOT/home --bind
 sudo mount /proc $FEDORA_ROOT/proc --bind
 sudo mount /sys $FEDORA_ROOT/sys --bind
 df
 sudo chroot $FEDORA_ROOT
* TODO: Install dependencies
* install the rpmbuild package
 yum install rpm-build
* Create a ~/.rpmmacros with those lines
 %packager      CLAM Team <clam@iua.upf.edu>
 %vendor        Universitat Pompeu Fabra
 %_topdir       /home/testfarm/rpmbuild
* Create the needed folders
 mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,RPMS/i386,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
* run the clam/CLAM/scripts/doSrcTarball.sh and move the tarballs to ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
* Do a symbolic link to the spec file
 ln -s clam/CLAM/scons/libs/clam.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
* Execute the script
 rpmbuild -ba /home/testfarm/rpmbuild/SPECS/clam-0.X.X.spec
** It will build a source rpm in ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS containing the tarball and the SPEC file 
** It will decompress the tarball into ~/rpmbuild/BUILD 
** It will call the build section from ~/rpmbuild/BUILD 
** It will call the install section with the specified BUILDROOT /var/tmp/CLAM-buildroot 
** It will build the binary rpm packages into ~/rpmbuild/RPMS
 # do whatever
* Once done, don't forget to exit the chroot and umount the mounted points
 exit
 sudo umount $FEDORA_ROOT/dev
 sudo umount $FEDORA_ROOT/home
 sudo umount $FEDORA_ROOT/proc
 sudo umount $FEDORA_ROOT/sys

== The proper way ==

'''In progress'''

Using mock to compile with up-to-date packages, different distributions and assure dependencies correctness.


* Init the chroot (you need to do this just once)
 mock --debug -r fedora-6-i386-core init

* Add additional sources to the mock configuration at /etc/mock/fedora-6-i386-core.cfg

* Later builds, just need to update it
 mock --debug -r fedora-6-i386-core chroot yum update
