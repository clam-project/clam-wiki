For the main clam libraries, trunk/CLAM compiling is usually simple: `scons` and `sudo scons install` .  Since the configuration is already done, I haven't posted this part, which is slightly more complicated.  There doesn't seem to be any need for QT, so that makes it much easier than the other clam directors

I'll post more when I use it, but I don't usually have any problems w/ it.
