All the examples here can be built by using the same template of SConstruct file that is presented in [[Building a processing library]] section just changing the line:

 install = env.Install(os.path.join(CLAMInstallDir,'lib','clam'), libraries)

by:

 install = env.Install(os.path.join(CLAMInstallDir,'lib','ladspa'), libraries)
