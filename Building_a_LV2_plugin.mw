[http://lv2plug.in/ LV2] is an standard for audio plugins succesor of [http://ladspa.org LADSPA]. LV2 support in CLAM is still experimental, so expect changes in the way plugins are built. 

Because of that this page is quite poor. Until it becomes stable the better and most updated reference is at the example you can find [http://clam-project.org/clam/trunk/CLAM/examples/PluginExamples/Lv2PluginExample/ here] which wraps a couple of networks as plugins in a single lv2 bundle.

You can also find useful information at the [http://clam-project.org/clam/trunk/CLAM/scripts/clam_lv2_generator.1 man page for clam_lv2_generator program] which is used in the example to generate most files required by the plugin.

== UI support ==

UI support is quite experimental and adhoc. The goal is supporting three use cases:
# Automated Qt ui generation given the properties of the network
# Custom Qt ui binded to the network by using special properties like Prototyper does (indeed the goal is reusing ui's).
# Hand programmed Qt interface, using facilities to interact with the network.

We are currently working in automatic generation (case 1) but using facilities that will enable case 2.

Notice that at time of writting this Qt support in LV2 is quite limited but we found a nice way of wrapping Qt widgets into Gtk.
