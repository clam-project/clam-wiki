This document explains how to modify the CHANGES file on a release.

The versioning in CLAM and applications is fully controlled by the CHANGES files. This file is used to generate version info in credits, and packaging names. The resulting version is 



== In between releases ==

* CHANGE files for CLAM should look like that
 00-00-2007 CLAM 1.0 SVN $Revision: 09999 $
 'The release i want to release'
  * Change 1
  * Change 2
 
 00-00-2006 CLAM 0.99.99
 'The past released release'
 * Revision 08888
 * Change 3

* And for applications:
 00-00-2007 NetworkEditor 0.4.6 SVN $Revision: 09999 $
 'The release i want to release'
  * Using CLAM 1.0
  * Change 1
  * Change 2
 
 00-00-2006 NetworkEditor 0.99.99
 'The past released release'
 * Revision 08888
 * Using CLAM 0.99.99
 * Change 3

* This way the long version will be 1.0~svn09999
* ''The svn number is the revision of the last CHANGE not the overall repository revision, so modify the CHANGES files to get it updated.''

== About to release ==

* Remove the SVN addition to the release id
* Put a '$REVISION$' to as a change entry
 00-00-2007 CLAM 1.0
 'The release i want to release'
  * $Revision$
  * Change 1
  * Change 2
* After commit and update it will look like this
 00-00-2007 CLAM 1.0
 'The release i want to release'
  * $Revision: 10000 $
  * Change 1
  * Change 2
* This will generate a short and log version '1.0'
* Generate all the packaging
* ''If you do changes while packaging do also a commit on CHANGES to update the revision''

== After release ==

* Remove the $ signs around the Revision so the revision gets freeze
* Add the new version ending with the 'SVN $Revision$'  
 ??-??-2007 CLAM 1.1 SVN $Revision$
 'The target release after this release'
