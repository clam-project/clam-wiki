Besides the content of this application template we will evaluate community

== Dedication and availability ==

It is very important to set a working plan for your project.
You need to be aware of the time you have is the key to size your project goals.
Also, you need a very close relation with your mentor 
who might be in a very different point in the world and not always available.
So having the following information will help us a lot.

* Are you going to have any other occupation during the period (studying, jobs...)? Which one? How many hours it will take you?
* Are you planning to get any days off during the period (trips, exams...)? Which ones or how many?
* Are you planning to be offline (unreachable online) but working? How many days or which ones?
* Where are you from? Which is the timezone? 
* Which will be your normal asleep-and-online hours?

* Which are your main working platforms?
* How much do you use free software?
* How familiarized you are with free software development?
** I regularly report bugs to the programs I use
** I have compiled free software from source
** I have been sent patches to some free software projects (which one, size, involved technologies, your contributions...)
** I have been involved in free software projects (which one, size, involved technologies, your contributions...)
