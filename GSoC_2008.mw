Mentors are the current active developers who are very engaged with the project.
We also have incorporated as mentors GSoC 2007 students who have been actively 
contributing along the year beyond the program.

We are considering that they will have enough time and availability during summer,
deep knowledge on the project, and above all, commitment to it.
