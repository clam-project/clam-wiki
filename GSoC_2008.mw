= Draft of the student application template =

Besides the content of this application template we will evaluate community 
involvement and (irc/mail) talks with mentors and community members.
A badly sized or badly focused project can be fixed in this way.

'''So, please, after filling the application, get in contact with us.'''

== Motivation ==

* What do you expect to get from the program?
* Why did you chose CLAM?
* Which is your current academic situation and topic?
* Why do you think you are elegible?
* Any drawback with you we should know?

== Dedication and availability ==

It is very important to set a working plan for your project.
You need to be aware of the time you have is the key to size your project goals.
Also, you need a very close relation with your mentor 
who might be in a very different point in the world and not always available.
So having the following information will help us a lot.

* How many hours a week (mean dedication) do you plan for the project?
* Are you going to have any other occupation during the period (studying, jobs...)? Which one? How many hours it will take you?
* Are you planning to get any days off during the period (trips, exams...)? Which ones or how many?
* Are you planning to be offline (unreachable online) but working? How many days or which ones?
* Where are you from? Which is the timezone? 
* Which will be your normal asleep-and-online hours?

== Previous CLAM involvement ==

We will value previous experience or involvement with CLAM and its community.
So highlight in your application experiences and involvement you already had. Such as:
* "I have used XXX CLAM based applications for doing XXX"
* "I have compiled library/applications from sources"
* "I have already coded my own project using CLAM which consist in..."
* "I reported bugs to the mailinglist/bug tracking system/irc"
* "I sent patches to the CLAM list (which ones)"
* "I helped other CLAM users"/"I was helped by other CLAM users"
* "I did commits on the svn as XXX svn user"
* "I took conversations on the IRC channels with CLAM developers as [nick} regarding [topic]"
* I sent mails to CLAM related mailing lists (email, topics)
* I have met CLAM developers (some reference we could remember)

It's a normal situation that students do not have any previous involvement.
But you can  [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Devel#Getting_involved increase your involvement] '''until the day we choose the students'''. Get sure we know you did, so we can value that.

== Technological background ==

* Which are your main working platforms?
* Which is your experience regarding open source as user, developer, supporter or within a given open source community?
* Briefly explain your experience with the following technologies:
** Signal processing
** Audio computer subsystems (hardware, jack, portaudio, osc, ladspa, vst...)
** SVN/CVS
** C++/GCC
** Python
** Qt
** CppUnit or similar, and test driven development
** Any technology not listed here being related to the project you choose

== Aditional information ==

* Any URL that could give us more information on you (technical-content blog, vitae, web page)
* Something we missed you find important

Mentors are the current active developers who are very engaged with the project.
We also have incorporated as mentors GSoC 2007 students who have been actively 
contributing along the year beyond the program.

We are considering that they will have enough time and availability during summer,
deep knowledge on the project, and above all, commitment to it.

== About The Program ==

===   What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? ===

We don't know any mechanism for dealing with disapparing students besides evaluating them badly.
But to avoid reaching that point we learned last year that mentors have to be very dedicated
to get results on the first part of the GSoC program.

We will set some flexible gloals that students should achieve.
Before starting the program they should, at least, have the development setup ready, 
a first list of tasks and having sent some patch.
After that we'll set up close remote-pair-programming sessions to get some early goals done
so that they get the methodology and could send their first valid patches.
This will continue until they have sent enough valid patches to be considered as commiters.
With some flexibility this should happen before the mid-term evaluation
when we will evaluate having done significant commits/patches.

We hope that developer live cycle and close mentor guiding will engage them with the project.
Beside that we would like to integrate them into the community 
by aggregating their blog in the planet, having nice talks at the IRC and 
interesting discussions with them on the mailing list.

=== What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? ===

Due to the close commitment of the mentors that can happen just by major causes.
But even if this happens, most mentors are flexible enough to collaboratively cover orphan students.
In fact, last year, mentors supported each other all the time with their students.

=== What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program? ===

In order they integrate into project's community
we will ask them to send queries to their mentor to the mailing list instead of directly to his mailbox,
we will encourage them to use the IRC channel to ask questions even when their mentor is not present,
we will invite them to subscribe their blogs in the [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/planet CLAM plannet],
we will be carefull letting them answering questions of users and other students, 
before providing an answer ourselves,
telling them that doing so will be evaluated very positively.

At the end of the program we will ask them for things that they would like to do in CLAM beyond GSoC,
in order to motivate them to keep contributing.

=== What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes? ===
 
That's really a difficult task.
We'll try to provide a very warm community feeling being very supportive.
At the end of the program we will ask them thinking things that they would like to do in CLAM beyond GSoC, 
in order to motivate them to keep contributing.
