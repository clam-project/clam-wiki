= For your SoC Application =

These are the questions we would like you to address in your application. Besides the content of it we will evaluate community involvement and (irc/mail) talks with mentors and community members.
A badly sized or badly focused project can be fixed in this way.

'''So, please, after filling the application, get in contact with us.'''

== Motivation ==

* What do you expect to get from the program?
* Why did you chose CLAM?
* Which is your current academic situation and topic?
* Why do you think you are elegible? What are your biggest strengths/weaknesses?

== Dedication and availability ==

It is very important to set a working plan for your project.
You need to be aware of the time you have is the key to size your project goals.
Also, you need a very close relation with your mentor 
who might be in a very different point in the world and not always available.
So having the following information will help us a lot.

* How many hours a week (mean dedication) do you plan for the project?
* Please, tell us whether, during the GSoC program, you will have any other ocupation, or you will be taking any days off (trips, exams...), or you will be GSoCing but not online.
* Which are/will be your normal UTC asleep-and-online hours?

== Previous CLAM involvement ==

We will value previous experience or involvement with CLAM and its community.
So highlight in your application experiences and involvement you already had. Such as:
* "I have used XXX CLAM based applications for doing XXX"
* "I have compiled library/applications from sources"
* "I have already coded my own project using CLAM which consist in..."
* "I reported bugs to the mailinglist/bug tracking system/irc"
* "I sent patches to the CLAM list (which ones)"
* "I helped other CLAM users"/"I was helped by other CLAM users"
* "I did commits on the svn as XXX svn user"
* "I took conversations on the IRC channels with CLAM developers as [nick} regarding [topic]"
* I sent mails to CLAM related mailing lists (email, topics)
* I have met CLAM developers (some reference we could remember)

It's a normal situation that students do not have any previous involvement.
But you can  [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Devel#Getting_involved increase your involvement] '''until the day we choose the students'''. Get sure we know you did, so we can value that.
