Unsorted tasks
==============

Not all the following tasks are meant to be part of the GSoC project.

spectral transformations
------------------------

-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") tweak some processings, bounds setting, adding defaults, etc.
-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") (high) harmonizer: port it to realtime and NE
-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") harmonizer algorithm improvement (detunning and delay added)
-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") (high) morph: port it to realtime and NE
-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") (high) pitch-discretization: port it realtime and NE
-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") make a harmonizer prototype with sliders to control each voice pitch gain
-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") time-stretch algorithm port basis
-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") new hoarseness network

-   (high) time-stretch: finish the rt port and have it working in NE
-   Fix gender change: already rt. Improve residual
-   make a network (and a prototype) to control harmonizer voices by midi (needs lv2 host implementation)
-   fix SMS pitch-shift artifacts (bug)
-   improve morph algorithm
-   check if any mAmount dependency remains

audio to midi
-------------

-   ![](done.png "fig:done.png") fundamental to MIDI at NE and Audio2MIDI test network
-   realtime voice2midi (needs lv2 host implementation)
-   make a network with rt audio to midi-output (needs lv2 host implementation)
-   piano-roll widget for networkeditor/prototyper (needs lv2 host implementation)
