Chordata is an easy to use application, built using the CLAM framework,
to analyze the tonal features (harmony, chords...) of your digital music
and explore them by navigating along the song using different useful views.
It is addressed to amateur musicians who want to know the chords of their favorite songs
but it is also very useful to get insight of the music itself.

== Selecting a song ==

By clicking on the 'Open' icon ([[Image:Open.png]), a window will pop up.
You can choose any audio file in your hard drive.
The application supports many formats: ogg, wav, mp3, flac, aiff... but not wma, 

Once you select the song, the application will start to analyze it.
Depending on your machine and your operating system that could last a couple of minutes or some few seconds.

As soon as the analysis ends the song starts playing and the views start moving.

== Navigating along the song ==


The usage of the buttons to play [[Image:Icon-Play.png]], pause [[Image:Icon-Pause.png]] and stop [[Image:Icon-Stop.png]] should be obvious
as well as the use of the progress slider to move along the song.

But if you are playing an instrument while looking at the application keyboard bindings would be more useful than handling the mouse.
* You can play and pause using the space bar. 
* You can stop the song by using the Escape key
* You can move back and forward by using the left and right cursor keys.
* You can move back and forward faster by using the PgUp and PgDown keys.
* You can go to the end and to the beginning by using the Home and End keys.


== Understanding the views ==
