=== What is CLAM? ===

CLAM is a development framework to build Audio and Music applications. You can use CLAM as a library to program your applications in C++ but it also provides graphical tools to build applications without coding. CLAM provides an uniform interface to facilities that addresses complex tasks in audio applications such as audio devices, audio files, thread safe communication, DSP algorithm reconvination and scaling...

CLAM is distributed along with some example applications that are usefull by themselves.

=== I want to start using CLAM, how do I approach CLAM as user or as developer? ===

The guide "[[Approaching CLAM]]" will advice you the proper steps to take depending on your goals and level of expertise.

=== I want to get involved with CLAM project, what steps should I take ===

Often we advice possible contributors to follow [[Devel#Getting_involved|those steps]]

=== I want to upgrade my code to a new CLAM version, what does has changed? ===

We summarize all the sensible changes that you will require to upgrade your code from one CLAM version to the next on the [[Version Migration Guide]].

=== Why does CLAM depend on so many 3rd party libraries? ===

CLAM aims at offering all necessary services for building an audio and music application. This implies many different tools and possible requirements. Some of those tools already exist and, as it makes no sense implementing them from scratch, all we do is take them and provide them all under an uniform interface that eases their combination. 

CLAM would be unthinkable without the great work of all those developers.

== Compilation ==

=== When compiling the NetworkEditor i get an 'Undefined Interface' error ===

This error is normally caused because the moc command does not receive the proper '-I' option pointing to the path of Qt4's QtDesigner includes.

This problem is solved in a distinct way depending on the platform. Check the INSTALL file and the user contributed platform specific installation guides on the wiki.
