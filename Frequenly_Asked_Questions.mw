== General ==

=== What is CLAM? ===

CLAM is a development framework for building applications and doing research on the audio and music domain. You can use CLAM as a library to program your applications in C++ but you can also use graphical tools to build full applications without coding. CLAM provides an uniform interface to several facilities that addresses complex tasks in audio applications such as audio devices, audio files, thread safe communication, DSP algorithm reconvination and scaling...

CLAM is distributed along with some example applications that are usefull by themselves.

=== What does CLAM stands for? ===

CLAM is the acronym for ''C++ Library for Audio and Music'' and it is also a pun on the catalan word 'clam' which means ''clamor'', a continuous sound produced by a large number of people as to show approval or disapproval of a given event.

=== Is CLAM a "library" or a "framework"? ===

CLAM is a software framework as defined by Ralph E. Johnson. CLAM does not only offer a set of functionalities but also provides a conceptual metamodel or way of doing things. Read [http://www.iua.upf.es/~xamat/Thesis|X. Amatriain's PhD thesis] if you are interested on this theoretical discussion.

=== Will CLAM suit my needs? ===

This is of course the million dollar question. It is difficult to be sure whether CLAM can suit your needs until you really try it out. Nevertheless, here are a few hints that may help you decide:
* CLAM can be used for audio analysis and synthesis It is specially well-suited for spectral analysis/synthesis
* It includes features that make it suitable for Music Information Retrieval
* It can be used to build real-time, efficient applications
* In any case you should keep on reading the rest of this FAQ as well as any other CLAM documentation that can help you out in the decision.

=== I want to start using CLAM, how do I approach CLAM as user or as developer? ===

The guide "[[Approaching CLAM]]" will advice you the proper steps to take depending on your goals and level of expertise.

=== I want to get involved with CLAM project, what steps should I take ===

Often we advice possible contributors to follow [[Devel#Getting_involved|those steps]]

=== I want to upgrade my code to a new CLAM version, what does has changed? ===

We summarize all the sensible changes that you will require to upgrade your code from one CLAM version to the next on the [[Version Migration Guide]].

=== Why does CLAM depend on so many 3rd party libraries? ===

CLAM aims at offering all necessary services for building an audio and music application. This implies many different tools and possible requirements. Some of those tools already exist and, as it makes no sense implementing them from scratch, all we do is take them and provide them all under an uniform interface that eases their combination. 

CLAM would be unthinkable without the great work of all those developers.

== Compilation ==

=== When compiling the NetworkEditor i get an 'Undefined Interface' error ===

This error is normally caused because the moc command does not receive the proper '-I' option pointing to the path of Qt4's QtDesigner includes.

This problem is solved in a distinct way depending on the platform. Check the INSTALL file and the user contributed platform specific installation guides on the wiki.
