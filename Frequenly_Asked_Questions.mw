== I want to start using CLAM, how do I approach CLAM as user or as developer? ==

The guide "[[Approaching CLAM]]" will advice you the proper steps to take depending on your goals and level of expertise.

== I want to get involved with CLAM project, what steps should I take ==

Normally we advice possible contributors to follow [[Devel#Getting_involved|those steps]]

== I want to upgrade my code to a new CLAM version, what does has changed? ==

We summarize all the sensible changes that you will require to upgrade your code from one CLAM version to the next on the [[Version Migration Guide]].

= Compilation =

== When compiling the NetworkEditor i get an 'Undefined Interface' error ==

This error is normally caused because the moc command does not receive the proper '-I' option pointing to the path of Qt4's QtDesigner includes.

This problem is solved in a distinct way depending on the platform. Check the INSTALL file and the user contributed platform specific installation guides on the wiki.
