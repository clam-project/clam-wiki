'''Abstract:'''
This project plans to add MIDI support in the Network Editor and enhance the CLAM's Framework MIDI implementation.
The main goal of the project includes:

* Rewriting the control class to accept typed controls, not only floats. (this is usefull beyond MIDI implementation)
* Creating Source and Sinks to interface with PortMIDI
* Creating MIDI Processings that are useful for music.
* Create some demo networks.
