This manual chapter gives hints on how to migrate existing code from one version of CLAM to another hihglighting code level incompatibilities and new ways of doing things.

== 0.95.0 to 0.95.1 ==

OutControl::AddLink and OutControl::RemoveLink receive references instead of pointer as parameter.

== 0.91.0 to 0.95.0 ==

The classes <tt>MonoAudioFileReader</tt> and <tt>MultiChannelFileReader</tt> take at the configuration an <tt>AudioFileSource</tt> instead of an <tt>AudioFile</tt>.
Also <tt>MonoAudioFileWriter</tt> and <tt>MultiChannelFileWriter</tt> take <tt> AudioFileTarget</tt>. This has been changed for the automatically generated interface to treat them differently.
