= Proposed ideas for the 2009 SoC =

''Skills'' does not refer to skills that the student should have at the moment of application
you adquire it in sort time before the coding starts.

''Difficulty'' stands on how deep the student should get inside CLAM core.
Often a given project can be completed just using the framework but
some projects needs understanding or modifying the core of the framework.
= Core =

== Static network scheduling algorithm ==

'''Description:''' 
Current flow control algorithm on each backend callback
looks to the available inputs and outputs and 
decides which processing should be run.
Pau's Thesis describes a new scheduling algorithm that
given the hopsizes and windows of all the ports of all the processings,
it can build a periodic execution plan so we can save 
all the real-time decision making.

The algorithm is currently implemented in python,
and we should integrate it in C++ inside CLAM.

TODO: add a link to Pau's Thesis

'''Required skills:'''
* Proficiency in C++
* Linear algebra concepts (matrices)
* Understanding a Python script to translate current implementation


'''Difficulty:''':
Medium.

'''Priority:'''
High

== Hot-wiring ==

'''Description:'''
 Currently any change to the network structure such as adding or removing processings, connecting them are not realtime safe and the network playback is stopped for safety reasons. This project would enable changing connections without stopping the network. 

That means doing real-time safe changes on the network structure. Some known techniques exist to do that and mentors will provide guidance on how to address core classes.
 
'''Required skills:'''
* Proficiency on C++-
* Basic notions of threading
* Having some knowledge on the CLAM core classes implementation would be perfect but not required.

'''Difficulty:''': Hard.

'''Priority:''' Medium.

== Run-time errors handling and back-end polishing ==

'''Description:''' 
CLAM should have a way of handling errors in the Do method.
Currently errors in configuration are allowed but
few but important conditions are to be handled after Start().
As the exceptions come from the audio processing thread
but should be handled at the interface thread,
the error should be catched by the backend and communicated
in a thread safe way to the interface.

This scheme of communication should be used also to notify
the application of the backend status:
Handling special events such xruns, server down,
parameter changes such as the buffer size or the sampling rate...

'''Required skills:'''
* Proficiency in C++
* CLAM processing execution cicle
* Backend technologies (portaudio, jack)
* Multithread communication
* Qt

'''Difficulty:''': Medium.

'''Priority:''' High.

== Network Scalability (aka Subnetworks) ==

'''Status:''' Checkout [[Network_scalability_and_Blender_integration]]

'''Description:''' One compeling issue in CLAM is addressing scalability for the visual builder. That means building processings modules out of a composition of existing ones. CLAM supports that just by coding (ProcessingComposites), but one could consider sinks and sources of a network the ports and controls of a brand new processing.
A project to address that should include:
* Infrastructure to control the flow of recursive networks
* Integrating user-defined networks in the component library.
* Providing user interface on the NetworkEditor.
* ...

'''Priority:''' High.

= NetworkEditor enhancements =

== Porting Network Canvas to Qt Graphics View ==

The NetworkCanvas (the main widget for NetworkEditor) was implemented before QGraphicsView
and implements most of the features that it provides but less efficient.
This project consists on porting NetworkCanvas to QGraphicsView.
Side actions to take are generalizing the widget to a general model than
can be use, for example to connect Jack clients or other patching tools.

'''Skills:'''
* Familiarity with the QGraphicsView framework


== Qt designer integration ==

'''Description:'''
The current way of binding designer widgets and clam processings is by naming the widgets with a name you can copy from the network editor.
This is practical but not that nice and error prone.
We would like to have closer integration so that from the designer
you can access information from a network.
Bindings could be stored as custom properties instead
and can be added via menus of qt extensions.
Other integrations are to be considered such as
designer embedding in the network editor,
or embedding the interface in the clamnetwork file.

'''Priority:''' Medium but if we find a designer expert we would like to take profit of it.

'''Required skills:'''
* Qt designer extension plugins
* Qt metaobject introspection

'''Difficulty:''': High.


== VST plugins prototyped with CLAM and Qt ==

'''Description:''' Currently the Prototyper enables wrapping network in an interface built in with Qt Designer and play them as Jack or PortAudio application. We would like to do the same with VST plugins.
The problem is that VST have their own graphical loop control instead of QT's.
In a first [https://llistes.projectes.lafarga.org/pipermail/clam-devel/2009/003065.html spike]
we achieved to run Qt interfaces in a VST host but still some work is needed.
* Properly handle user events, focus, geometry...
* Binding the interface to the CLAM network as Prototyper does
* Providing a graphical generator from NetworkEditor

'''Priority:''' High
'''Skills:'''
* VST plugins programming
* Qt (basic programming and event handling)
* CLAM (Ports and controls enumeration and usage, Ladspa wrappers, VST wrapper)

== Qt widgets ==

'''Description:''' 
CLAM provides several sets of widgets to be used in applications.
* Control widgets (sliders, knobs, surface pads...)
* Configuration parameter editors
* Data views (instant and time line data)
* Data editors (segments, bpf's...)
This project consists in developing nice set of widgets 
so that we can build nice applications with them,
while evolving the prototyping framework to ease their use.

'''Required skills:'''
* Qt
* Thread safe programming

'''Priority:''' High.

'''Difficulty:''': Medium to high.

= Processing repository =

== New spectrum migration ==

Old CLAM Spectrum have multiple representations inside:
Complex array, polar array, separate magnitude and phase arrays, 
That could seem convenient but at the end of the day
all the processing dealing with spectrum had to deal with
all the possible convinations of representations, and to
synchronize the information if several of them were used.

To avoid that complexity, we developed, for the spatialization plugin,
a set of single representation spectrums, operators and converters,
that simplified a lot the spectral processings.

This project consists on extending its use to spectrum based processings in CLAM, such as:
* Spectral transformations
* SMS analysis, synthesis and transformations

The project should relay on b2b testing in order not to break existing code base.

'''Skills:'''
* C++ proficiency
* Unit and back-to-back testing principles
* Basic signal processing

== Audio file access revamped ==

Current audio file access processings have several limitations, so we started an spike for new ones.
The limitations were:
* They are not real-time safe (access to files locks the thread)
* They are not samplerate safe (depending on the file the samplerate varies so the rest of the network cannot guess the sample rate)
* They are not channel safe (when you change the file output channels vary and connections are lost)

Current spike just address real-time safety and channel safety and just libsndfile formats are supported.
So, main to-do's related to this project are:
* Support formats that are currently supported by the old processings (libogg, libmad...)
* Do implicit sample rate conversion to the backend (libsamplerate)
* Provide seeking control and position information
* Provide access to metadata like old processing do (libid3)
* Optionally add support for new formats (libflac, libspeex...)
* Migrate the current code base to the new processings

'''Skills:'''
* C++ proficiency
* Look-free structures
* CLAM processing encapsulation (ports, control, configs...)
* Understanding on audio file formats

== Integrating external libraries ==

Integrating one or more of those libraries could be great

=== libsamplerate ===

'''Description:''' Working with different samplerates is a hard problem now in CLAM. One solution could be using network configuration parameters (see [[SoC_ideas#Relative_configurations_and_network_configuration|GSoC project]]).
still, wave file could provide different samplerates thant the Also integration with FileReaders and Writers and with Backends will be useful.

This project consists in providing both a good Resampling processing and minimizing samplerate impedance between processings requiring a given samplerate, audio files and the audio backend.

'''Required skills:'''
* Basic knowledge about signal processing.
* Experience working with third party libraries.

'''Difficulty:''': Simple. May be part of a greater project (checkout [[SoC_ideas#Relative_configurations_and_network_configuration]])

'''Current status:''' An existing experiment of processing exists as plugin. Still  it is not working properly and proper configuration parameters must be found.

'''Priority:''' High

=== Libflac and libspeex ===

CLAM's AudioFileReaders/Writers use different backends for audio loading and saving.
Such backends offers the readers and writers a common interface to several libraries.
Current underlying libraries are
sndfile for wav, aiff, au, and others, libmad for MP3 and liboggvorbis for ogg/vorbis.

There are some other libraries developed at http://xiph.org/ which support other formats:
* libflac supports FLAC which is a lossless compression format
* libspeex supports speex format which is specialized on voice compression

This project will consist on adding support for such libraries in CLAM.

=== Aubio ===

Aubio provide nice realtime onset detection algorithms.
One project could be integrating aubio as processing(s) into clam.
Other task to be done is to create an Annotator extractor for Aubio.
There is an outdated example in CLAM/Example/TickExtractor 
that did tempo tracking and meter estimation for the Annotator.
Development on such example was discontinued during a period when aubio license was not clearly GPL.
Now it needs some work to have it working again.

This project could consist in providing processings that makes aubio features
availables on the NetworkEditor or/and making the TickExtractor example working again.



= New standalone applications =

End user applications are interesting because they increase the user base and project visibility. Building CLAM based applications require skills on Qt.

==Network based music tracker==

'''Description:''' Network based music tracker. Controls being sequenced in time in a order list plus pattern way.

'''Required skills:'''
* C++ and Qt
* Experience as user with trackers.

'''Difficulty:''': Moderate.

== Educational vowel synthesizer ==

'''Description:'''
Build a educative program that would consist on:
* synthesizing different vowels by placing a point within the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_triangle Vowel triangle],
* and, the reverse, given an input vowel from the microphone place a dot on the triangle, so the students can check their pronunciation.  Here's a [http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=191299&ssid=54864 screenshot] of what a Vowel triangle might look like, additionally with '[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram Voronoi]' regions shown - showing what the near misses are most likely to be confused with in a particular language. 

This could be enhanced by:
* displaying the mouth position for the vowel,
* visualizing the spectral peaks so they can identify the effect,
* changing the pitch,
* changing the synthesized gender,
* changing the vocal track characteristics,
* extracting user's vocal track characteristics for synthesized sound.

A teacher could limit the set of vowels to the ones used for 
a particular language such as Catalan or English,
so that the students just see the relevant ones for the exercise.

'''Note:''' Last year a student focused on having some of the processing working. Processing still needs work but this year we will like to focus on the interface so we can say the application exists, and then enhance the processing as secondary goal.

'''Difficulty:''': Moderate.

'''Priority''': Medium.

== Real-time synthesizer using SMS models ==

Salto is a CLAM legacy application to synthesize Saxo.
This project consist on revamp a very simple Salto like synthesizer.
Previous GSoC projects developed the basic technology for loading
databases and controlling the synthesis.
This year we should center on having 
a final application or plugin that users may use easily 
although it also would require refining the algorithm and databases 
as we have them now.

'''Skills:'''
* Qt interfaces
* Audio plugins development
* XML management
* Python

= Annotator and description data pools =

Core CLAM developers are dedicated to real time processing issues and 
they have interest on someone taking care of this key application.
Tasks of the following proposals can be mixed up in a single proposal
if they build a coherent set.

See also [[Devel/Annotator_TODO's]] for further ideas.


== Coretize Annotator Pool features ==

High priority on Annotator front.

Parts of this project can be added to another Annotator based project to add priority bonus or it can be a project by itself if you are a refactoring fanatic.

Annotator schemas have some features that are implemented in
specific classes not in the core CLAM Pool related classes.
In consequence, Annotator has an ill duplication of structures, 
and also other CLAM based applications cannot benefit of such features.
This project would consist on merging such features in the common Pool related classes in CLAM core, refactoring the Annotator code base and enhancing/redesigning the Pool API usability.

== Annotator data type and view plugins ==

High priority on Annotator front.

Many parts of the annotator are defined as plugin based: 
Type management, type dependant table editors, instant views, 
time evolution views and auralization.
Those plugins are not real plugins as they are not loaded dlls,
but clam already has solved multiplatform dll loading for plugins.

This project would consist in cleaning up the API's of each
set of plugins and making them loadable dll's so that third party
users can extend pool types and annotator views.

== Annotation Merger ==

High priority on Annotator front.

This project consist in implementing an interface in the Annotator to
merge and select the outputs of different existing extractors into a single project.
That would be useful for example to combine in a project, 
chords extracted automatically by an algorithm, with hand annotated ground truth
while keeping both in separated files.

BOCA interface was able to merge several annotation sources,
such as extractors, databases and webservices, 
as a unique Annotator descriptors file (data pool).
Python scripts developed to implement that do pretty well to 
define merges, projections and attribute renaming 
of several annotation sources (extractors, databases, webservices...).

BOCA merging scripts are distributed with the annotator.
With some knowledge you can build a python extractor that does the merge.
But for regular users this is not that intuitive to write an script,
so this project proposes to build:
* A graphical interface to build merging script
* Some extra application logic needed to launch several extractors and to mapping back pool modifications.

== VAMP plugins on the Annotator ==

VAMP is the feature extraction plugin system used by SonicVisualizer.
This project would consist in being able to lauch VAMP plugins within the Annotator
and integrating its results in an Annotator data pool.

== Web services based extractors ==

Building extractors that call public web services such as Lastfm, MusicBrainz, EchoNest... and wraps the results as CLAM data pool xml to be open by the Annotator.

== Pool based web services ==

Another possibility is offering web services that given an audio excerpt
they return you the descriptors as an xml pool with or as any other existing format.

== Macro manipulation of descriptors with python on Annotator ==

Make the annotation data accessible to python scripts
so that one can automate repetitive descriptors manipulation.
Some use cases:
* "I want to correct an offset that a given segment annotation adds to all segments"
* "I want to extend a regular beat annotation and just correct when it varies"

== Enhancing Segment Editor ==

* Selection and edit actions (copy, paste..)
* Overlapping segments
* Displaying segment attributes as height
* Displaying segment attributes as color
* Using metadata: Units, intervals...

== Enhancing Annotator Views ==

* Bring more CLAM monitors as instant views
* Time evolution views for multibin frame parameters (spectrums, pcp's, chord correlation...)
* Better frame level float editor

== Flexible auralization on Annotator ==

Annotator provides auralization for the user to check the descriptors.
But auralization capabilities are limited to
playing a click on segment onset and 
float value frame level descriptors controlling the pitch of an oscillator.
By adding a general way to convert descriptors to control signals
they can be used to control an arbitrary synthesizer set by the user.
Possible solutions for that  could be a CLAM network with selected hooks
for descriptors or generating OSC or MIDI to control a synthesizer.

This project consists in:
* Define controllers that can take attributes on the pool data to control a network
* Recode Annotator auralizer to use networks and to feed in control values
* Provide the interface to configure auralizators for each project
* Build several useful auralizations.

== Configuration parameters for extractors ==

Currently there is no way of specifying configuration parameters to the extractors.
Each extractor could have their own parameters so we need a system to deal with such flexibility but still being simple to define new extractors.

* Defining a special extractor option to query the parameters (name, type, range, defaults...) as the one we have to query the output data schema.
* Implementing the interface to query such parameters depending on the extractor.
* Launching the extractor feeding the parameters
* Offering a C++/python solution to ease the programming of extractors with configuration.

= Continuation of past projects =
=== MIDI support ===

'''Status:''' Checkout [[GSoC/MIDI_Implementation_for_Network_Editor]] past gsoc project
 
'''Description:'''
* NetworkEditor: Realtime Input/Output using portmidi. Read/Write on files
* Improve and update all the MIDI support of the framework

=== Standalone chord extractor application ===

'''Status: ''' Checkout [[GSoC/Standalone_chord_extractor_application|chordata (former turnaround)]] past gsoc project.

'''Description''': (deprecated)
We have the chord extraction running whithin Annotator, NetworkEditor, Offline, but none of these applications are addressed towards the real use that one can make of such technology being a guitar player.

This project consists on building an application which addresses usability issues for the use case that some one want to learn the chords of a song.

Some of the concrete use cases to be addressed are:

* Most of user actions should consist on single key actions (no control keys) to facilitate usage with an musical instrument at hand.
* Precomputing a song when loading it.
* Playback
** Preloading the song 
** Moving fastforward and backwards
** Playing a limited length of the song and then back
** Replay from the same point
** Time stretch playback
* Display
** A scrolling segmentation view
** Segmentation view should have chord text displayed
** Segmentation view should have a different color for each chord for the user to associate them. Maybe different color association per song or maybe using a color/pattern combination for Root/Mode.

=== Integrate Faust with CLAM ===

'''Status:''' Checkout [[Network_scalability_and_Blender_integration]] (nearly complete)

FAUST http://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/ is a functional language for audio processing. A faust module can be compiled as a ladspa plugin and then loaded into a clam network.
[http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Image:NetEditor-faust-svg-embedded.png Screenshot] showing SVG diagrams into CLAM NetworkEditor: 
Thigs to be added:
* Display faust diagrams (svg) embedded in clam processing boxes. Navigable (hierarchically) faust diagrams
* On-the-fly compilation of faust modules
* Faust code editing within clam networkeditor

=== Enhancing NetworkEditor Usability ===

* Add undo/redo support.
* Add the possibility of save all the controls values to have networks ready to play (like a patch).
* Multi-wiring (drag more than a wire on multiport processings)
* Any other feature that could enhance the usability

== SMSTools ==

=== Improve usability of SMSTools workflow ===

'''Description:'''
* Remove the files to process from the configuration and use configuration as presets
* Data to open are just audio or analysis data
* Object centric interaction: you apply an action (synthesis, analysis, transform) to an object
* Minimize the provided data by using object information (sampling rate on analysis, and most of the analysis parameters embedded on the object for resynthesis)

'''Priority:''' Low

=== Convergence of SMSTools and CLAM widgets infrastructure ===

'''Description:'''
* Transformation parameter automation using time-lines (ala ardour automation)
* Metadata based widgets
* Widgets interaction (zoom)
* Network based transformations. The user should be able to define the transformation chain using NetworkEditor.

'''Priority:''' Low

Those ideas were discarded to be offered as SoC project but if you are still interested, just ask.

== CLAM documentation ==

* Document CLAM's examples and review tutorials
* Ideal project for non-expert first timers

== CLAM web browser plug-in ==

* Develop a plugin for basic CLAM Network edition through a web browser.
