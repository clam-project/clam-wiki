Restrict the on_... method names to the ones that are implicitly connected 
slots which follow qt naming conventions to implicitly connect slots. For 
example onLaunchBrowser would be launchBrowser.

In general the conventions for slots and signals
Signals: <tt>somethingHappened()</tt>   (using past)
Slots: <tt>doThatThink</tt>   (imperative, just like a regular method)
so that when you connect you can read:
When emmiter somethingHappened receiver doThatThing

Then the explicitly connected slots are named
<tt>on_uiObjectName_signalName()</tt>
I use them mostly with actions defined on the ui to avoid having to do:

 connect(_ui->uiActionName, SIGNAL(triggered()), this, SLOT(doThat()))

Also I saw you are emiting slots or regular methods. Don't emit methods not 
being signals, just call them. If you call an slot within the class just call 
it like a regular function. Just emit signals, not slots neither regular 
methods.

In this case, I don't know if you did so, but anyway is a good advice to 
anyone new (or not that new) to qt: avoid using the signal slot mechanism 
when the signal is not directly an user event but code you write, and you 
know who is the receiver object and the receiver method. New people to Qt get 
entusiastic with sigslot mechanism which is powerful but has less compile 
time checks, is hard to trace and adds signal resolution overhead. 
Annotator's vmqt is a good example on over use and it is a hell to understand 
it ;-)

== Icons ==

* In a given application, place the icons in src/images/
* Include them in a src/images.qrc file in the :/icons/ path
* SVG format is preferred over PNG.
* For stock icons use the crystalsvg theme
* Write down the path of copied stock icons in src/images/origin.txt so that they could be updated as a whole when we change/update the theme.
