'''Abstract:'''

:The CLAM NetworkEditor is a powerful tool to easily make complex audio processing units ("networks") without need to write a single line of code. But if you want to do a big network with many processing boxes, even if it's a simple process could be difficult to understand the signals flows. The use of subnetworks allows to group the processing boxes by levels, allowing not only to simplify the reading of signals flows, but also allowing the users to improve their designs in an object-oriented way, making new processing units connecting and grouping previous ones.
:That is the main idea of the network scalability proposal.
