This is the CLAM development wiki.

''Please, prepend 'Devel/' to any development pages you create here.''

Some development pages are still at the [https://iua-share.upf.es/wikis/clam_draft| old CLAM development wiki].

[[Development screenshots]] show last achievements on CLAM development branch.

[http://clam.iua.upf.edu/testfarm Testfarm web] shows the last commits and build and tests status in different platforms in real-time.

== Subversion access ==
Subversion tree contains CLAM libs and applications: NetworkEditor, Annotator, SMSTools and Voice2MIDI
* Open and read-only 
 $ svn co http://iua-share.upf.edu/svn/clam/trunk clam
* With write permissions. You need an account at iua-share.
 $ svn co svn+ssh://<usrname>@iua-share.upf.edu/mnt/svn/clam/trunk clam

== Getting involved ==

To get involved with CLAM development:
* Subscribe to the [https://llistes.projectes.lafarga.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/clam-devel clam development mailing list].
* Contact other CLAM developers at the #clam channel of the FreeNode IRC network.
* Blog (occasionally) about CLAM and syndicate your feed in the [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/planet clam planet].
* Fill bugs in our [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/bugreporting.html bug tracking tool].
* Fix bugs and send a patch ;-)

== Tasks ==

* [[Devel/Release task list]]
* [[Devel/Current release TODOs]] short-term tasks.
* [[Devel/Plugins TODOs]] short and mid-term tasks.
* [[Devel/Ladspa Plugins TODOs]] short-term tasks. Mostly taken by Andreas Calvo.
* [[Devel/Faust integration TODOs]] short-term tasks. Mostly taken by Andreas Calvo.
* [[Devel/Web TODOs]].
* [[SoC ideas]]
* [[Devel/Annotator TODO's]]
* [[Devel/Infrastructure Refactoring TODO's]]
* [[Devel/Spectral Transformations TODOs]] GSoC project tasks. Mostly taken by Hern√°n Ordiales

== Hot Spots ==

Things that core developers are eager to address but still not being refined in small tasks. Of course they need discussion.

* Protocol allowing processings to let the network decide its (audio) port size. 
* Parameter propagation through the data-flow
* Recursive networks
* Static network scheduling (Maybe based on an recursive analysis starting from sinks)
* Ease Processing writing: not make a config attribute mandatory.
* Unify Do() return semantics. One solution is do it void Do()
* Spectrum refactoring: one class per representation (complex, mag-phase, ...)

== HOWTO's ==

* [[Devel/Changelog release policy]]
* [[Devel/Compile and install troubleshooting]]
* [[Devel/Mac OSX build]]
* [[Devel/Linux Gentoo build]]
* [[Devel/Windows build]] with MS Visual Studio 2005 
* [[Devel/Windows MinGW build]]
* [[Devel/Windows MinGW cross compile]]
* [[Devel/Eclipse]]
* [[Devel/Building RPM's]]

== Prepare and apply a patch ==

We only give write access to the repository to developers with experience with clam development. But this not a problem since you can always send a patch to the devel-list, and clam-devs will take care of it (and we use to be quick).

We like receiving patches very much. Please do it even for very small things like improving the INSTALL file, or grammar corrections in the code comments. (So imagine how we like receiving bug-fixes!).
Luckily, working with patches in subversion is very easy:

* How to create a patch with your local modifications?
: Change dir to the '''root of your svn tree''' (under CLAM/ and NetworkEditor/, etc.) and do 
: <pre>$ svn diff > good-description.patch</pre>

* How to apply a patch (that maybe somebody posted to the list)?
: Change dir to the root of your svn tree and do
: <pre>$ patch -p0 < the.patch
</pre>

We prefer the patches being sent to the '''clam-devel mailing list'''. The issue tracker will be used when patches can not be applied (or discarded) immediately and need to remain on hold for some time.
