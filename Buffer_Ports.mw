= CLAM Buffer Ports TODOs =

== HoaEncoder ==

* '''DONE''' Transform the input port (AudioInPort)  into input port (InPort<Audio>)
* '''DONE''' Transform the output ports (AudioOutPort) into output ports (OutPort<Audio>)

== Vbap3D ==

* Transform the input port (AudioInPort)  into input port (InPort<Audio>)
* Transform the output ports (AudioOutPort) into output ports (OutPort<Audio>)

== General Tasks ==

* Test the BackendBufferSize to demostrate the correct function.
* To create AudioSink with Buffer.
* To create AudioSource with Buffer.
* Stream2Buffer and Buffer2Stream using the BackendBufferSize.
* Allow connecting multiple channel into the single conection in AudioSink. 
** Ex. 15 channels (like Hoa) to single conection (AudioSink)
* Look and testing the Host/Backendwhen when change the BufferSize in runtime.
* Solve the memory problem, when resize buffer in the method "Do".

== Benchmark ==
   
* Using ''callgrind'' to compare the efficiency with the buffer implementation.
