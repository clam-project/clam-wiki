[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology Virtual Studio Technology] (VST) is a plugin system introduced by [http://steinberg.net Steinberg] which is mainly used in Windows and Mac.

You can embed a CLAM network, like the ones edited with the [[Network Editor tutorial|Network Editor]], and create a VST plugin for Windows.

No documentation on this issue is available but this [http://clam-project.org/clam/trunk/CLAM/examples/PluginExamples/VstPluginExample/ example].

== VST GUI ==

The former example also contains the grassroots of an implementation for Qt based guis for VST, so future development lines will focus on getting Prototyper interfaces working as VST GUI plugins.

Anyway this part of the development is quite stuck because the dificulty of setting the crosscompiling environment so any pushing patches are very welcome.
