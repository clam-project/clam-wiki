= 1.4.0, '3D molluscs in the space' =

The CLAM project is delighted to announce the long awaited 1.4.0 release
of [http://clam-project.org CLAM, the C++ framework for audio and music], 
code name ''3D molluscs in the space''. 


In summary, this long term release 
includes a lot of new spacialization modules for '''3D audio''';
'''MIDI''', '''OSC''' and '''guitar effects''' modules;
architectural enhancements such as '''typed controls''';
nice '''usability''' features for the NetworkEditor interface;
convenience tools and scripts to make CLAM experience better;
enhanced building of LADSPA plugins and new support for '''LV2 and VST''' plugin building;
a new easy to use application to explore songs chords called '''Chordata'''; many optimizations, bug fixing and code clean ups.

Some highlights of the release:

* '''Chordata''' is a new CLAM application which offers a user friendly way to explore the chords of your favourite songs, using already existing technology in the CLAM framework but with a much simpler interface.  [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVmkIznjUPE Video]]

* The spacialization module and helper tools, contributed by [http://barcelonamedia.org Barcelona Media] audio group, turn CLAM in tandem with Blender and Ardour, into a powerful 3D audio authoring and exhibition platform. Here you can see some related [ videos and papers].

* Typed controls extend CLAM with the ability to use whichever C++ type as the message for a control. So, not just floats, but also bools, enums, integers, or envelopes can be sent as asynchronous controls. Examples on boolean and MIDI controls are provided.

* NetworkEditor has been ported to the [http://doc.trolltech.com/latest/qgraphicsview.html QGraphicsView] framework. Dealing with heavy networks such the [[ones]] used in Barcelona Media have pushed many usability enhancements into its interface: multi-wire dragging, wire highlighting, default port and control actions, network and in-canvas documentation... See them in action in this [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kt0WDmvMwo video]]

* It also made necessary to provide a tool such clamrefactor.py to perform batch high level changes to clam network XML files such as renaming processing types, ports, or configuration parameters, changing configuration values, duplicating sets of processings, connecting them...

* Music Annotator application now is designed to aggregate several sources of descriptors and update them after edit. Descriptors are mapped to a work description schema that can be graphically defined. Also semantic web descriptor sources to access webservices such as MusicBrainz have been implemented. [[ Video1]]

=== Chordata 1.0.0 ===

Chordata is a simple but powerful application that analyses the chords of any music file in your computer. You can use it to travel back and forward the song while watching insightful visualizations of the tonal features of the song. Key bindings and mouse interactions for song navigation are designed thinking in a musician with an instrument at hands. Don't miss the demo video.

The CLAM team enraptured to announce the 1.3.0 release of [http://clam.iua.upf.edu CLAM, the C++ framework for audio and music],
code name ''The Shooting of the Flying Plugins release''. 

Highlights of this release are:
* NetworkEditor [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Image:LadspaPropertiesDialog.png automatically generates and compiles] a [http://www.ladspa.org/ LADSPA plugin] containing the network you are editing. CLAM also provides a [http://iua-share.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Building_a_LADSPA_plugin new simple API to code that by hand yourself].
* More [http://faust.grame.fr FAUST] integration into network editor: edit faust code, compile, reload, view the svg diagrams (Natanael Olaiz GSoC)
* Lots of usability enhancements on the NetworkEditor: cut&paste, context menus to connect ports, keyboard shortcuts, default double click actions, and a processing tree filter (Natanael Olaiz GSoC)
* Annotator has also enhanced its functionality (Wang Jun GSoC):
** You can build a project that aggregates content from several extractors
** Extractors may have a config file
** Extractors can write back data (useful if the extractor is a database of webservice and needs to upload modifications)
* New ProgressControl widget and paired AudioFileMemoryLoader processing to support seeking (Pawel Bartkiewicz GSoC)
* A bunch of new 3D spatialization processings from [http://www.barcelonamedia.org/ CI Barcelona Media] audio research group.
* [http://audiores.uint8.com.ar/blog/2008/07/07/clam-processing-generator-script-example-of-use/ Scripts] and [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Image:ProcessingCodeGenerator.png graphical front-end] to generate a native CLAM plugin project from scratch.
* [http://audiores.uint8.com.ar/blog/2008/08/03/interactive-clam-programming/ Experimental Python bindings] ([http://iua-share.upf.edu/svn/clam/trunk/CLAM/pyclam/INSTALL still just-for-hackers install procedure])
* TickExtractor example is compiling again (many thanks to Amaury Hazan from MTG-UPF)
* Development deployment for Windows native compilation using MinGW (Wang Jun GSoC)

And a lot of small nice features and fixes you will appreciate for sure.
Source and binary packages for different platforms are available at the [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/download.html CLAM download page].

We are very excited on what next releases promise us. Some ongoing work:
* Generating other types of network based plugins and programs (LV2, JACK, VST...),
* Subnetworks (Natanael Olaiz GSoC)
* Improved [http://opensoundcontrol.org/ OSC] support, 3D scene descriptors parametrization receivers processings and [http://www.blender.org/ Blender] exporter to the spatialization processing choreographer. (Natanael Olaiz GSoC - [http://dadaisonline.blogspot.com/search/label/blender related blogging])
* Typed controls (Francisco Tufro GSoC)
* A new musician-oriented standalone [http://iua-share.upf.edu/svn/clam/trunk/Turnaround/ chord extraction application] (Pawel Bartkiewicz GSoC)
