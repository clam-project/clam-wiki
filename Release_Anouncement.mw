= 1.3.0 =

We are enraptured to announce the 1.3.0 release of [http://clam.iua.upf.edu CLAM, the C++ framework for audio and music],
code name ''The binary clones factory release''. 

Highlights of this release are:
* NetworkEditor [http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Image:LadspaPropertiesDialog.png automatically generates and compiles] [http://www.ladspa.org/ LADSPA plugins] from a network definition and CLAM provides a [http://iua-share.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Building_a_LADSPA_plugin new simple API to code that by hand yourself].
* More [http://faust.grame.fr FAUST] integration into network editor: edit faust code, compile, reload, view the svg diagrams (Nathanael Olaiz GSoC)
* A graphical front-end to generate a native CLAM plugin project from scractch.
* Lots of usability enhancements on the NetworkEditor: cut&paste, context menus to connect ports and processing tree filter (Nathanael Olaiz GSoC)
* Annotator has also enhanced its functionality (Wang Jun GSoC):
** It can build a project that takes aggregated content of several extractors
** Extractors may have a config file
** Extractors can write back data (useful if the extractor is a database of webservice and needs to upload modifications)
* New ProgressControl widget and paired AudioFileMemoryLoader processing supporting seeking (Pawel Bartkiewicz GSoC)
* A bunch of new 3D spatialization processings from [http://www.barcelonamedia.org/ CI Barcelona Media] audio research group.

And a lot of small nice features and fixes you will appreciate for sure.
