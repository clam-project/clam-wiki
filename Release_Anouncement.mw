Highlights of this release are:

* More [http://faust.grame.fr FAUST] integration into network editor: edit faust code, compile, reload, view the svg diagrams (Nathanael Olaiz GSoC)
* Lots of usability enhancements on the NetworkEditor: cut&paste, context menus to connect ports, keyboard shortcuts, default double click actions, and a processing tree filter (Nathanael Olaiz GSoC)
* Annotator has also enhanced its functionality (Wang Jun GSoC):
** You can build a project that aggregates content from several extractors
** Extractors may have a config file
** Extractors can write back data (useful if the extractor is a database of webservice and needs to upload modifications)
* New ProgressControl widget and paired AudioFileMemoryLoader processing to support seeking (Pawel Bartkiewicz GSoC)
* A bunch of new 3D spatialization processings from [http://www.barcelonamedia.org/ CI Barcelona Media] audio research group.
