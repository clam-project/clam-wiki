== How to insert variables in a clam assert message? (which is something extremely useful) ==

 if ( error-condition )
 {
   std::ostringstream os;
   os
     << "err message: "
     << "some var: " << var
     << std::flush;
   CLAM_ASSERT(false, os.str().c_str());
 }

== How to plot any kind of data for debugging purposes? ==

In short, write out the data to standard output and then use python with pylab to plot it.

Now, in detail:
In your code, typically in a loop, put cout's like this: 
 std::cout << data << std::endl;
Then execute the program piping to a file
 ./OfflinePlayer mynetwork.clamnetwork > debug.plot
Open a python shell an use plot and show commands of pylab. 
Like in this example (note the [:-1] is to remove the last empty line)
 import pylab
 pylab.plot( file("debug.plot").readlines()[:-1] )
 pylab.show()
